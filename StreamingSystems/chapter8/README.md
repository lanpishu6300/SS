 # Chapter 8. Streaming SQL

Let’s talk SQL. In this chapter, we’re going to start somewhere in the middle
with the punchline, jump back in time a bit to establish additional context,
and finally jump back to the future to wrap everything up with a nice bow.
Imagine Quentin Tarantino held a degree in computer science and was super
pumped to tell the world about the finer points of streaming SQL, and so he
offered to ghostwrite this chapter with me; it’s sorta like that. Minus the
violence.
