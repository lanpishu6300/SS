 # Chapter 9. Streaming Joins

When I first began learning about joins, it was an intimidating topic; LEFT,

OUTER, SEMI, INNER, CROSS: the language of joins is expressive and
expansive. Add on top of that the dimension of time that streaming brings to
the table, and you’re left with what appears to be a challengingly complex
topic. The good news is that joins really aren’t the frightening beast with
nasty, pointy teeth that they might initially appear to be. As is the case with
so many other complex topics, after you understand the central ideas and
themes of joins, the broader landscape that’s built on top of these basics
suddenly becomes so much more accessible. So please join me now as we
explore the fascinating topic of...well, joins.
