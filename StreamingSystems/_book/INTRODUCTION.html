<h1 id="preface-or-what-are-you">Preface Or: What Are You</h1>
<h1 id="getting-yourself-into-here">Getting Yourself Into Here?</h1>
<p>Hello adventurous reader, welcome to our book! At this point, I assume that
you&#x2019;re either interested in learning more about the wonders of stream
processing or hoping to spend a few hours reading about the glory of the
majestic brown trout. Either way, I salute you! That said, those of you in the
latter bucket who don&#x2019;t also have an advanced understanding of computer
science should consider how prepared you are to deal with disappointment
before forging ahead; <em>caveat piscator</em> , and all that.</p>
<p>To set the tone for this book from the get go, I wanted to give you a heads up
about a couple of things. First, this book is a little strange in that we have
multiple authors, but we&#x2019;re not pretending that we somehow all speak and
write in the same voice like we&#x2019;re weird identical triplets who happened to be
born to different sets of parents. Because as interesting as that sounds, the end
result would actually be less enjoyable to read. Instead, we&#x2019;ve opted to each
write in our own voices, and we&#x2019;ve granted the book just enough self-
awareness to be able to make reference to each of us where appropriate, but
not so much self-awareness that it resents us for making it only into a book
and not something cooler like a robot dinosaur with a Scottish accent.</p>
<p>As far as voices go, there are three you&#x2019;ll come across:</p>
<p>Tyler</p>
<pre><code>That would be me. If you haven&#x2019;t explicitly been told someone else is
speaking, you can assume that it&#x2019;s me, because we added the other
authors somewhat late in the game, and I was basically like, &#x201C;hells no&#x201D;
when I thought about going back and updating everything I&#x2019;d already
written. I&#x2019;m the technical lead for the Data Processing Languages ands
Systems group at Google, responsible for Google Cloud Dataflow,
Google&#x2019;s Apache Beam efforts, as well as Google-internal data
</code></pre><pre><code>1
</code></pre><pre><code>2
</code></pre><p>processing systems such as Flume, MillWheel, and MapReduce. I&#x2019;m also
a founding Apache Beam PMC member.</p>
<pre><code>Figure P-1. The cover that could have been...
</code></pre><p>Slava</p>
<pre><code>Slava was a long-time member of the MillWheel team at Google, and
later an original member of the Windmill team that built MillWheel&#x2019;s
successor, the heretofore unnamed system that powers the Streaming
Engine in Google Cloud Dataflow. Slava is the foremost expert on
watermarks and time semantics in stream processing systems the world
over, period. You might find it unsurprising then that he&#x2019;s the author of
Chapter 3, Watermarks.
</code></pre><p>Reuven</p>
<pre><code>Reuven is at the bottom of this list because he has more experience with
stream processing than both Slava and me combined and would thus
crush us if he were placed any higher. Reuven has created or led the
creation of nearly all of the interesting systems-level magic in Google&#x2019;s
general-purpose stream processing engines, including applying an untold
amount of attention to detail in providing high-throughput, low-latency,
exactly-once semantics in a system that nevertheless utilizes fine-grained
checkpointing. You might find it unsurprising that he&#x2019;s the author of
Chapter 5, Exactly-Once and Side Effects. He also happens to be an
Apache Beam PMC member.
</code></pre><h2 id="navigating-this-book">Navigating This Book</h2>
<p>Now that you know who you&#x2019;ll be hearing from, the next logical step would
be to find out what you&#x2019;ll be hearing about, which brings us to the second
thing I wanted to mention. There are conceptually two major parts to this
book, each with four chapters, and each followed up by a chapter that stands
relatively independently on its own.</p>
<p>The fun begins with Part I, <em>The Beam Model</em> (Chapters 1 &#x2013; 4 ), which focuses
on the high-level batch plus streaming data processing model originally
developed for Google Cloud Dataflow, later donated to the Apache Software
Foundation as Apache Beam, and also now seen in whole or in part across
most other systems in the industry. It&#x2019;s composed of four chapters:</p>
<pre><code>Chapter 1, Streaming 101 , which covers the basics of stream
processing, establishing some terminology, discussing the
capabilities of streaming systems, distinguishing between two
important domains of time (processing time and event time), and
finally looking at some common data processing patterns.
</code></pre><pre><code>Chapter 2, The What, Where, When, and How of Data Processing ,
which covers in detail the core concepts of robust stream processing
over out-of-order data, each analyzed within the context of a
concrete running example and with animated diagrams to highlight
the dimension of time.
Chapter 3, Watermarks (written by Slava), which provides a deep
survey of temporal progress metrics, how they are created, and how
they propagate through pipelines. It ends by examining the details of
two real-world watermark implementations.
</code></pre><pre><code>Chapter 4, Advanced Windowing , which picks up where Chapter 2
left off, diving into some advanced windowing and triggering
concepts like processing-time windows, sessions, and continuation
triggers.
</code></pre><p>Between Parts I and II, providing an interlude as timely as the details
contained therein are important, stands Chapter 5, <em>Exactly-Once and Side
Effects</em> (written by Reuven). In it, he enumerates the challenges of providing
end-to-end exactly-once (or effectively-once) processing semantics and walks
through the implementation details of three different approaches to exactly-
once processing: Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.</p>
<p>Next begins Part II, <em>Streams and Tables</em> (Chapters 6 &#x2013; 9 ), which dives deeper
into the conceptual and investigates the lower-level &#x201C;streams and tables&#x201D; way
of thinking about stream processing, recently popularized by some
upstanding citizens in the Apache Kafka community but, of course, invented
decades ago by folks in the database community, because wasn&#x2019;t everything?
It too is composed of four chapters:</p>
<pre><code>Chapter 6, Streams and Tables , which introduces the basic idea of
</code></pre><pre><code>streams and tables, analyzes the classic MapReduce approach
through a streams-and-tables lens, and then constructs a theory of
streams and tables sufficiently general to encompass the full breadth
of the Beam Model (and beyond).
</code></pre><pre><code>Chapter 7, The Practicalities of Persistent State , which considers the
motivations for persistent state in streaming pipelines, looks at two
common types of implicit state, and then analyzes a practical use
case (advertising attribution) to inform the necessary characteristics
of a general state management mechanism.
Chapter 8, Streaming SQL , which investigates the meaning of
streaming within the context of relational algebra and SQL, contrasts
the inherent stream and table biases within the Beam Model and
classic SQL as they exist today, and proposes a set of possible paths
forward toward incorporating robust streaming semantics in SQL.
</code></pre><pre><code>Chapter 9, Streaming Joins , which surveys a variety of different join
types, analyzes their behavior within the context of streaming, and
finally looks in detail at a useful but ill-supported streaming join use
case: temporal validity windows.
</code></pre><p>Finally, closing out the book is Chapter 10, <em>The Evolution of Large-Scale
Data Processing</em> , which strolls through a focused history of the MapReduce
lineage of data processing systems, examining some of the important
contributions that have evolved streaming systems into what they are today.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>As a final bit of guidance, if you were to ask me to describe the things I most
want readers to take away from this book, I would say this:</p>
<pre><code>The single most important thing you can learn from this book is the
theory of streams and tables and how they relate to one another.
Everything else builds on top of that. No, we won&#x2019;t get to this topic
until Chapter 6. That&#x2019;s okay; it&#x2019;s worth the wait, and you&#x2019;ll be better
</code></pre><pre><code>prepared to appreciate its awesomeness by then.
</code></pre><pre><code>Time-varying relations are a revelation. They are stream processing
incarnate: an embodiment of everything streaming systems are built
to achieve and a powerful connection to the familiar tools we all
know and love from the world of batch. We won&#x2019;t learn about them
until Chapter 8, but again, the journey there will help you appreciate
them all the more.
</code></pre><pre><code>A well-written distributed streaming engine is a magical thing. This
arguably goes for distributed systems in general, but as you learn
more about how these systems are built to provide the semantics
they do (in particular, the case studies from Chapters 3 and 5 ), it
becomes all the more apparent just how much heavy lifting they&#x2019;re
doing for you.
LaTeX/Tikz is an amazing tool for making diagrams, animated or
otherwise. A horrible, crusty tool with sharp edges and tetanus, but
an incredible tool nonetheless. I hope the clarity the animated
diagrams in this book bring to the complex topics we discuss will
inspire more people to give LaTeX/Tikz a try (in &#x201C;Figures&#x201D;, we
provide for a link to the full source for the animations from this
book).

<p>There are a handful of associated online resources to aid in your enjoyment of
this book.</p>
<h2 id="figures">Figures</h2>
<p>All the of the figures in this book are available in digital form on the book&#x2019;s
website. This is particularly useful for the animated figures, only a few
frames of which appear (comic-book style) in the non-Safari formats of the
book:</p>
<pre><code>Online index: http://www.streamingbook.net/figures
</code></pre><pre><code>Specific figures may be referenced at URLs of the form:
http://www.streamingbook.net/fig/&lt;FIGURE-NUMBER&gt;
For example, for Figure 2-5: http://www.streamingbook.net/fig/2-
</code></pre><p>The animated figures themselves are LaTeX/Tikz drawings, rendered first to
PDF, then converted to animated GIFs via ImageMagick. For the more
intrepid among you, full source code and instructions for rendering the
animations (from this book, the &#x201C;Streaming 101&#x201D; and &#x201C;Streaming 102&#x201D; blog
posts, and the original Dataflow Model paper) are available on GitHub at
<em><a href="http://github.com/takidau/animations" target="_blank">http://github.com/takidau/animations</a></em>. Be warned that this is roughly 14,
lines of LaTeX/Tikz code that grew very organically, with no intent of ever
being read and used by others. In other words, it&#x2019;s a messy, intertwined web
of archaic incantations; turn back now or abandon all hope ye who enter here,
for there be dragons.</p>
<h2 id="code-snippets">Code Snippets</h2>
<p>Although this book is largely conceptual, there are are number of code and
psuedo-code snippets used throughout to help illustrate points. Code for the
more functional core Beam Model concepts from Chapters 2 and 4 , as well as
the more imperative state and timers concepts in Chapter 7, is available
online at <em><a href="http://github.com/takidau/streamingbook" target="_blank">http://github.com/takidau/streamingbook</a></em>. Since understanding
semantics is the main goal, the code is provided primarily as Beam
PTransform/DoFn implementations and accompanying unit tests. There is
also a single standalone pipeline implementation to illustrate the delta
between a unit test and a real pipeline. The code layout is as follows:</p>
<p>src/main/java/net/streamingbook/BeamModel.java</p>
<pre><code>Beam PTransform implementations of Examples 2-1 through 2-9 and
Example 4-3, each with an additional method returning the expected
output when executed over the example datasets from those chapters.
</code></pre><p>src/test/java/net/streamingbook/BeamModelTest.java</p>
<pre><code>Unit tests verifying the example PTransforms in BeamModel.java via
generated datasets matching those in the book.
</code></pre><p>src/main/java/net/streamingbook/Example2_1.java</p>
<pre><code>Standalone version of the Example 2-1 pipeline that can be run locally or
using a distributed Beam runner.
</code></pre><p>src/main/java/net/streamingbook/inputs.csv</p>
<pre><code>Sample input file for Example2_1.java containing the dataset from the
book.
</code></pre><p>src/main/java/net/streamingbook/StateAndTimers.java</p>
<pre><code>Beam code implementing the conversion attribution example from
Chapter 7 using Beam&#x2019;s state and timers primitives.
</code></pre><p>src/test/java/net/streamingbook/StateAndTimersTest.java</p>
<pre><code>Unit test verifying the conversion attribution DoFns from
StateAndTimers.java.
</code></pre><p>src/main/java/net/streamingbook/ValidityWindows.java</p>
<pre><code>Temporal validity windows implementation.
</code></pre><p>src/main/java/net/streamingbook/Utils.java</p>
<pre><code>Shared utility methods.

<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>Last, but certainly not least: many people are awesome, and we would like to
acknowledge a specific subset of them here for their help in creating this
tome.</p>
<p>The content in this book distills the work of an untold number of extremely
smart individuals across Google, the industry, and academia at large. We owe
them all a sincere expression of gratitude and regret that we could not
possibly list them all here, even if we tried, which we will not.</p>
<p>Among our colleagues at Google, much credit goes to everyone in the
DataPLS team (and its various ancestor teams: Flume, MillWheel,
MapReduce, et al.), who&#x2019;ve helped bring so many of these ideas to life over
the years. In particular, we&#x2019;d like to thank:</p>
<pre><code>Paul Nordstrom and the rest of the MillWheel team from the Golden
Age of MillWheel: Alex Amato, Alex Balikov, Kaya Bekiro&#x11F;lu,
Josh Haberman, Tim Hollingsworth, Ilya Maykov, Sam McVeety,
</code></pre><pre><code>Daniel Mills, and Sam Whittle for envisioning and building such a
comprehensive, robust, and scalable set of low-level primitives on
top of which we were later able to construct the higher-level models
discussed in this book. Without their vision and skill, the world of
massive-scale stream processing would look very different.
</code></pre><pre><code>Craig Chambers, Frances Perry, Robert Bradshaw, Ashish Raniwala,
and the rest of the Flume team of yore for envisioning and creating
the expressive and powerful data processing foundation that we were
later able to unify with the world of streaming.
Sam McVeety for lead authoring the original MillWheel paper,
which put our amazing little project on the map for the very first
time.
Grzegorz Czajkowski for repeatedly supporting our evangelization
efforts, even as competing deadlines and priorities loomed.
</code></pre><p>Looking more broadly, a huge amount of credit is due to everyone in the
Apache Beam, Calcite, Kafka, Flink, Spark, and Storm communities. Each
and every one of these projects has contributed materially to advancing the
state of the art in stream processing for the world at large over the past
decade. Thank you.</p>
<p>To shower gratitude a bit more specifically, we would also like to thank:</p>
<pre><code>Martin Kleppmann, for leading the charge in advocating for the
streams-and-tables way of thinking, and also for investing a huge
amount of time providing piles of insightful technical and editorial
input on the drafts of every chapter in this book. All this in addition
to being an inspiration and all-around great guy.
</code></pre><pre><code>Julian Hyde, for his insightful vision and infectious passion for
streaming SQL.
Jay Kreps, for fighting the good fight against Lambda Architecture
tyranny; it was your original &#x201C;Questioning the Lambda Architecture&#x201D;
post that got Tyler pumped enough to go out and join the fray, as
</code></pre><pre><code>well.
</code></pre><pre><code>Stephan Ewen, Kostas Tzoumas, Fabian Hueske, Aljoscha Krettek,
Robert Metzger, Kostas Kloudas, Jamie Grier, Max Michels, and the
rest of the data Artisans extended family, past and present, for
always pushing the envelope of what&#x2019;s possible in stream
processing, and doing so in a consistently open and collaborative
way. The world of streaming is a much better place thanks to all of
you.
</code></pre><pre><code>Jesse Anderson, for his diligent reviews and for all the hugs. If you
see Jesse, give him a big hug for me.
</code></pre><pre><code>Danny Yuan, Sid Anand, Wes Reisz, and the amazing QCon
developer conference, for giving us our first opportunity to talk
publicly within the industry about our work, at QCon San Francisco
2014.
</code></pre><pre><code>Ben Lorica at O&#x2019;Reilly and the iconic Strata Data Conference, for
being repeatedly supportive of our efforts to evangelize stream
processing, be it online, in print, or in person.
</code></pre><pre><code>The entire Apache Beam community, and in particular our fellow
committers, for helping push forward the Beam vision: Ahmet Altay,
Amit Sela, Aviem Zur, Ben Chambers, Griselda Cuevas, Chamikara
Jayalath, Davor Bonaci, Dan Halperin, Etienne Chauchot, Frances
Perry, Isma&#xEB;l Mej&#xED;a, Jason Kuster, Jean-Baptiste Onofr&#xE9;, Jesse
Anderson, Eugene Kirpichov, Josh Wills, Kenneth Knowles, Luke
Cwik, Jingsong Lee, Manu Zhang, Melissa Pashniak, Mingmin Xu,
Max Michels, Pablo Estrada, Pei He, Robert Bradshaw, Stephan
Ewen, Stas Levin, Thomas Groh, Thomas Weise, and James Xu.
</code></pre><p>No acknowledgments section would be complete without a nod to the
otherwise faceless cohort of tireless reviewers whose insightful comments
helped turn garbage into awesomeness: Jesse Anderson, Grzegorz
Czajkowski, Mari&#xE1;n Dvorsk&#xFD;, Stephan Ewen, Rafael J. Fern&#xE1;ndez-
Moctezuma, Martin Kleppmann, Kenneth Knowles, Sam McVeety, Mosha</p>
<p>Pasumansky, Frances Perry, Jelena Pjesivac-Grbovic, Jeff Shute, and
William Vambenepe. You are the Mr. Fusion to our DeLorean Time
Machine. That had a nicer ring to it in my head&#x2014;see, this is what I&#x2019;m talking
about.</p>
<p>And of course, a big thanks to our authoring and production support team:</p>
<pre><code>Marie Beaugureau, our original editor, for all of her help and support
in getting this project off the ground and her everlasting patience
with my persistent desire to subvert editorial norms. We miss you!
</code></pre><pre><code>Jeff Bleiel, our editor 2.0, for taking over the reins and helping us
land this monster of a project and his everlasting patience with our
inability to meet even the most modest of deadlines. We made it!
</code></pre><pre><code>Bob Russell, our copy editor, for reading our book more closely than
anyone should ever have to. I tip my hat to your masterful command
of grammar, punctuation, vocabulary, and Adobe Acrobat
annotations.
Nick Adams, our intrepid production editor, for helping tame a mess
of totally sketchy HTMLBook code into a print-worthy thing of
beauty and for not getting mad at me when I asked him to manually
ignore Bob&#x2019;s many, many individual suggestions to switch our usage
of the term &#x201C;data&#x201D; from plural to singular. You&#x2019;ve managed to make
this book look even better than I&#x2019;d hoped for, thank you.
</code></pre><pre><code>Ellen Troutman-Zaig, our indexer, for somehow weaving a tangled
web of offhand references into a useful and comprehensive index. I
stand in awe at your attention to detail.
</code></pre><pre><code>Rebecca Panzer, our illustrator, for beautifying our static diagrams
and for assuring Nick that I didn&#x2019;t need to spend more weekends
figuring out how to refactor my animated LaTeX diagrams to have
larger fonts. Phew x2!
Kim Cofer, our proofreader, for pointing out how sloppy and
inconsistent we were so others wouldn&#x2019;t have to.
</code></pre><p>Tyler would like to thank:</p>
<pre><code>My coauthors, Reuven Lax and Slava Chernyak, for bringing their
ideas and chapters to life in ways I never could have.
George Bradford Emerson II, for the Sean Connery inspiration.
That&#x2019;s my favorite joke in the book and we haven&#x2019;t even gotten to
the first chapter yet. It&#x2019;s all downhill from here, folks.
Rob Schlender, for the amazing bottle of scotch he&#x2019;s going to buy
me shortly before robots take over the world. Here&#x2019;s to going down
in style!
My uncle, Randy Bowen, for making sure I discovered just how
much I love computers and, in particular, that homemade POV-Ray
2.x floppy disk that opened up a whole new world for me.
My parents, David and Marty Dauwalder, without whose dedication
and unbelievable perseverance none of this would have ever been
possible. You&#x2019;re the best parents ever, for reals!
Dr. David L. Vlasuk, without whom I simply wouldn&#x2019;t be here
today. Thanks for everything, Dr. V.
</code></pre><pre><code>My wonderful family, Shaina, Romi, and Ione Akidau for their
unwavering support in completing this levianthantine effort, despite
the many nights and weekends we spent apart as a result. I love you
always.
My faithful writing partner, Kiyoshi: even though you only slept and
barked at postal carriers the entire time we worked on the book
together, you did so flawlessly and seemingly without effort. You
are a credit to your species.
</code></pre><p>Slava would like to thank:</p>
<pre><code>Josh Haberman, Sam Whittle, and Daniel Mills for being
codesigners and cocreators of watermarks in MillWheel and
subsequently Streaming Dataflow as well as many other parts of
</code></pre><pre><code>these systems. Systems as complex as these are never designed in a
vacuum, and without all of the thoughts and hard work that each of
you put in, we would not be here today.
Stephan Ewen of data Artisans for helping shape my thoughts and
understanding of the watermark implementation in Apache Flink.
</code></pre><p>Reuven would like to thank:</p>
<pre><code>Paul Nordstrom for his vision, Sam Whittle, Sam McVeety, Slava
Chernyak, Josh Haberman, Daniel Mills, Kaya Bekiro&#x11F;lu, Alex
Balikov, Tim Hollingsworth, Alex Amato, and Ilya Maykov for all
their efforts in building the original MillWheel system and writing
the subsequent paper.
Stephan Ewen of data Artisans for his help reviewing the chapter on
exactly-once semantics, and valuable feedback on the inner
workings of Apache Flink.
</code></pre><p>Lastly, we would all like to thank <em>you</em> , glorious reader, for being willing to
spend real money on this book to hear us prattle on about the cool stuff we
get to build and play with. It&#x2019;s been a joy writing it all down, and we&#x2019;ve done
our best to make sure you&#x2019;ll get your money&#x2019;s worth. If for some reason you
don&#x2019;t like it...well hopefully you bought the print edition so you can at least
throw it across the room in disgust before you sell it at a used bookstore.
Watch out for the cat.</p>
<p>Which incidentally is what we requested our animal book cover be, but
O&#x2019;Reilly felt it wouldn&#x2019;t translate well into line art. I respectfully disagree,
but a brown trout is a fair compromise.</p>
<pre><code>Or DataPLS, pronounced Datapals&#x2014;get it?
Or don&#x2019;t. I actually don&#x2019;t like cats.
