Streaming 101\nStreaming data processing is a big deal in big data these days, and for good\nreasons; among them are the following:\nBusinesses crave ever-more timely insights into their data, and\nswitching to streaming is a good way to achieve lower latency\nThe massive, unbounded datasets that are increasingly common in\nmodern business are more easily tamed using a system designed for\nsuch never-ending volumes of data.\nProcessing data as they arrive spreads workloads out more evenly\nover time, yielding more consistent and predictable consumption of\nresources.\nDespite this business-driven surge of interest in streaming, streaming systems\nlong remained relatively immature compared to their batch brethren. It’s only\nrecently that the tide has swung conclusively in the other direction. In my\nmore bumptious moments, I hope that might be in small part due to the solid\ndose of goading I originally served up in my “Streaming 101” and\n“Streaming 102” blog posts (on which the first few chapters of this book are\nrather obviously based). But in reality, there’s also just a lot of industry\ninterest in seeing streaming systems mature and a lot of smart and active\nfolks out there who enjoy building them.\nEven though the battle for general streaming advocacy has been, in my\nopinion, effectively won, I’m still going to present my original arguments\nfrom “Streaming 101” more or less unaltered. For one, they’re still very\napplicable today, even if much of industry has begun to heed the battle cry.\nAnd for two, there are a lot of folks out there who still haven’t gotten the\nmemo; this book is an extended attempt at getting these points across.\nTo begin, I cover some important background information that will help\nframe the rest of the topics I want to discuss. I do this in three specific\nsections:\nTerminology\nTo talk precisely about complex topics requires precise definitions of\nterms. For some terms that have overloaded interpretations in current use,\nI’ll try to nail down exactly what I mean when I say them.\nCapabilities\nI remark on the oft-perceived shortcomings of streaming systems. I also\npropose the frame of mind that I believe data processing system builders\nneed to adopt in order to address the needs of modern data consumers\ngoing forward.\nTime domains\n```\nI introduce the two primary domains of time that are relevant in data\nprocessing, show how they relate, and point out some of the difficulties\nthese two domains impose.\n"},"chapter1/section1.1.html":{"url":"chapter1/section1.1.html","title":"Section1.1 Terminology: What Is Streaming?","keywords":"","body":"Terminology: What Is Streaming?\nBefore going any further, I’d like to get one thing out of the way: what is\nstreaming? The term streaming is used today to mean a variety of different\nthings (and for simplicity I’ve been using it somewhat loosely up until now),\nwhich can lead to misunderstandings about what streaming really is or what\nstreaming systems are actually capable of. As a result, I would prefer to\ndefine the term somewhat precisely.\nThe crux of the problem is that many things that ought to be described by\nwhat they are (unbounded data processing, approximate results, etc.), have\ncome to be described colloquially by how they historically have been\naccomplished (i.e., via streaming execution engines). This lack of precision\nin terminology clouds what streaming really means, and in some cases it\nburdens streaming systems themselves with the implication that their\ncapabilities are limited to characteristics historically described as\n“streaming,” such as approximate or speculative results.\nGiven that well-designed streaming systems are just as capable (technically\nmore so) of producing correct, consistent, repeatable results as any existing\nbatch engine, I prefer to isolate the term “streaming” to a very specific\nmeaning:\nStreaming system\nA type of data processing engine that is designed with infinite datasets in\nmind.\nIf I want to talk about low-latency, approximate, or speculative results, I use\nthose specific words rather than imprecisely calling them “streaming.”\nPrecise terms are also useful when discussing the different types of data one\nmight encounter. From my perspective, there are two important (and\northogonal) dimensions that define the shape of a given dataset: cardinality\nand constitution.\nThe cardinality of a dataset dictates its size, with the most salient aspect of\ncardinality being whether a given dataset is finite or infinite. Here are the two\nterms I prefer to use for describing the coarse cardinality in a dataset:\nBounded data\nA type of dataset that is finite in size.\nUnbounded data\nA type of dataset that is infinite in size (at least theoretically).\nCardinality is important because the unbounded nature of infinite datasets\nimposes additional burdens on data processing frameworks that consume\nthem. More on this in the next section.\nThe constitution of a dataset, on the other hand, dictates its physical\nmanifestation. As a result, the constitution defines the ways one can interact\nwith the data in question. We won’t get around to deeply examining\nconstitutions until Chapter 6, but to give you a brief sense of things, there are\ntwo primary constitutions of importance:\nTable\n1\nA holistic view of a dataset at a specific point in time. SQL systems have\ntraditionally dealt in tables.\nStream\nAn element-by-element view of the evolution of a dataset over time. The\nMapReduce lineage of data processing systems have traditionally dealt in\nstreams.\nWe look quite deeply at the relationship between streams and tables in\nChapters 6 , 8 , and 9 , and in Chapter 8 we also learn about the unifying\nunderlying concept of time-varying relations that ties them together. But until\nthen, we deal primarily in streams because that’s the constitution pipeline\ndevelopers directly interact with in most data processing systems today (both\nbatch and streaming). It’s also the constitution that most naturally embodies\nthe challenges that are unique to stream processing.\nOn the Greatly Exaggerated Limitations of\nStreaming\nOn that note, let’s next talk a bit about what streaming systems can and can’t\ndo, with an emphasis on can. One of the biggest things I want to get across in\nthis chapter is just how capable a well-designed streaming system can be.\nStreaming systems have historically been relegated to a somewhat niche\nmarket of providing low-latency, inaccurate, or speculative results, often in\nconjunction with a more capable batch system to provide eventually correct\nresults; in other words, the Lambda Architecture.\nFor those of you not already familiar with the Lambda Architecture, the basic\nidea is that you run a streaming system alongside a batch system, both\nperforming essentially the same calculation. The streaming system gives you\nlow-latency, inaccurate results (either because of the use of an approximation\nalgorithm, or because the streaming system itself does not provide\ncorrectness), and some time later a batch system rolls along and provides you\nwith correct output. Originally proposed by Twitter’s Nathan Marz (creator\nof Storm), it ended up being quite successful because it was, in fact, a\n2\nfantastic idea for the time; streaming engines were a bit of a letdown in the\ncorrectness department, and batch engines were as inherently unwieldy as\nyou’d expect, so Lambda gave you a way to have your proverbial cake and\neat it too. Unfortunately, maintaining a Lambda system is a hassle: you need\nto build, provision, and maintain two independent versions of your pipeline\nand then also somehow merge the results from the two pipelines at the end.\nAs someone who spent years working on a strongly consistent streaming\nengine, I also found the entire principle of the Lambda Architecture a bit\nunsavory. Unsurprisingly, I was a huge fan of Jay Kreps’ “Questioning the\nLambda Architecture” post when it came out. Here was one of the first highly\nvisible statements against the necessity of dual-mode execution. Delightful.\nKreps addressed the issue of repeatability in the context of using a replayable\nsystem like Kafka as the streaming interconnect, and went so far as to\npropose the Kappa Architecture, which basically means running a single\npipeline using a well-designed system that’s appropriately built for the job at\nhand. I’m not convinced that notion requires its own Greek letter name, but I\nfully support the idea in principle.\nQuite honestly, I’d take things a step further. I would argue that well-\ndesigned streaming systems actually provide a strict superset of batch\nfunctionality. Modulo perhaps an efficiency delta, there should be no need for\nbatch systems as they exist today. And kudos to the Apache Flink folks for\ntaking this idea to heart and building a system that’s all-streaming-all-the-\ntime under the covers, even in “batch” mode; I love it.\nBATCH AND STREAMING EFFICIENCY DIFFERENCES\nOne which I propose is not an inherent limitation of streaming systems,\nbut simply a consequence of design choices made in most streaming\nsystems thus far. The efficiency delta between batch and streaming is\nlargely the result of the increased bundling and more efficient shuffle\ntransports found in batch systems. Modern batch systems go to great\nlengths to implement sophisticated optimizations that allow for\nremarkable levels of throughput using surprisingly modest compute\nresources. There’s no reason the types of clever insights that make batch\nsystems the efficiency heavyweights they are today couldn’t be\nincorporated into a system designed for unbounded data, providing users\nflexible choice between what we typically consider to be high-latency,\nhigher-efficiency “batch” processing and low-latency, lower-efficiency\n“streaming” processing. This is effectively what we’ve done at Google\nwith Cloud Dataflow by providing both batch and streaming runners\nunder the same unified model. In our case, we use separate runners\nbecause we happen to have two independently designed systems\noptimized for their specific use cases. Long term, from an engineering\nperspective, I’d love to see us merge the two into a single system that\nincorporates the best parts of both while still maintaining the flexibility of\nchoosing an appropriate efficiency level. But that’s not what we have\ntoday. And honestly, thanks to the unified Dataflow Model, it’s not even\nstrictly necessary; so it may well never happen.\nThe corollary of all this is that broad maturation of streaming systems\ncombined with robust frameworks for unbounded data processing will in time\nallow for the relegation of the Lambda Architecture to the antiquity of big\ndata history where it belongs. I believe the time has come to make this a\nreality. Because to do so—that is, to beat batch at its own game—you really\nonly need two things:\nCorrectness\nThis gets you parity with batch. At the core, correctness boils down to\nconsistent storage. Streaming systems need a method for checkpointing\npersistent state over time (something Kreps has talked about in his “Why\nlocal state is a fundamental primitive in stream processing” post), and it\nmust be well designed enough to remain consistent in light of machine\nfailures. When Spark Streaming first appeared in the public big data\nscene a few years ago, it was a beacon of consistency in an otherwise\ndark streaming world. Thankfully, things have improved substantially\nsince then, but it is remarkable how many streaming systems still try to\nget by without strong consistency.\nTo reiterate—because this point is important: strong consistency is\n3\nrequired for exactly-once processing, which is required for correctness,\nwhich is a requirement for any system that’s going to have a chance at\nmeeting or exceeding the capabilities of batch systems. Unless you just\ntruly don’t care about your results, I implore you to shun any streaming\nsystem that doesn’t provide strongly consistent state. Batch systems don’t\nrequire you to verify ahead of time if they are capable of producing\ncorrect answers; don’t waste your time on streaming systems that can’t\nmeet that same bar.\nIf you’re curious to learn more about what it takes to get strong\nconsistency in a streaming system, I recommend you check out the\nMillWheel, Spark Streaming, and Flink snapshotting papers. All three\nspend a significant amount of time discussing consistency. Reuven will\ndive into consistency guarantees in Chapter 5, and if you still find\nyourself craving more, there’s a large amount of quality information on\nthis topic in the literature and elsewhere.\nTools for reasoning about time\nThis gets you beyond batch. Good tools for reasoning about time are\nessential for dealing with unbounded, unordered data of varying event-\ntime skew. An increasing number of modern datasets exhibit these\ncharacteristics, and existing batch systems (as well as many streaming\nsystems) lack the necessary tools to cope with the difficulties they impose\n(though this is now rapidly changing, even as I write this). We will spend\nthe bulk of this book explaining and focusing on various facets of this\npoint.\nTo begin with, we get a basic understanding of the important concept of\ntime domains, after which we take a deeper look at what I mean by\nunbounded, unordered data of varying event-time skew. We then spend\nthe rest of this chapter looking at common approaches to bounded and\nunbounded data processing, using both batch and streaming systems.\nEvent Time Versus Processing Time\n3\nTo speak cogently about unbounded data processing requires a clear\nunderstanding of the domains of time involved. Within any data processing\nsystem, there are typically two domains of time that we care about:\nEvent time\nThis is the time at which events actually occurred.\nProcessing time\nThis is the time at which events are observed in the system.\nNot all use cases care about event times (and if yours doesn’t, hooray! your\nlife is easier), but many do. Examples include characterizing user behavior\nover time, most billing applications, and many types of anomaly detection, to\nname a few.\nIn an ideal world, event time and processing time would always be equal,\nwith events being processed immediately as they occur. Reality is not so\nkind, however, and the skew between event time and processing time is not\nonly nonzero, but often a highly variable function of the characteristics of the\nunderlying input sources, execution engine, and hardware. Things that can\naffect the level of skew include the following:\nShared resource limitations, like network congestion, network\npartitions, or shared CPU in a nondedicated environment\nSoftware causes such as distributed system logic, contention, and so\non\nFeatures of the data themselves, like key distribution, variance in\nthroughput, or variance in disorder (i.e., a plane full of people taking\ntheir phones out of airplane mode after having used them offline for\nthe entire flight)\nAs a result, if you plot the progress of event time and processing time in any\nreal-world system, you typically end up with something that looks a bit like\nthe red line in Figure 1-1.\n\nFigure 1-1. Time-domain mapping. The x-axis represents event-time completeness in the\nsystem; that is, the time X in event time up to which all data with event times less than X\nhave been observed. The y-axis represents the progress of processing time; that is, normal\nclock time as observed by the data processing system as it executes.\nIn Figure 1-1, the black dashed line with slope of 1 represents the ideal,\nwhere processing time and event time are exactly equal; the red line\nrepresents reality. In this example, the system lags a bit at the beginning of\nprocessing time, veers closer toward the ideal in the middle, and then lags\n4\nagain a bit toward the end. At first glance, there are two types of skew visible\nin this diagram, each in different time domains:\nProcessing time\nThe vertical distance between the ideal and the red line is the lag in the\nprocessing-time domain. That distance tells you how much delay is\nobserved (in processing time) between when the events for a given time\noccurred and when they were processed. This is the perhaps the more\nnatural and intuitive of the two skews.\nEvent time\nThe horizontal distance between the ideal and the red line is the amount\nof event-time skew in the pipeline at that moment. It tells you how far\nbehind the ideal (in event time) the pipeline is currently.\nIn reality, processing-time lag and event-time skew at any given point in time\nare identical; they’re just two ways of looking at the same thing. The\nimportant takeaway regarding lag/skew is this: Because the overall mapping\nbetween event time and processing time is not static (i.e., the lag/skew can\nvary arbitrarily over time), this means that you cannot analyze your data\nsolely within the context of when they are observed by your pipeline if you\ncare about their event times (i.e., when the events actually occurred).\nUnfortunately, this is the way many systems designed for unbounded data\nhave historically operated. To cope with the infinite nature of unbounded\ndatasets, these systems typically provide some notion of windowing the\nincoming data. We discuss windowing in great depth a bit later, but it\nessentially means chopping up a dataset into finite pieces along temporal\nboundaries. If you care about correctness and are interested in analyzing your\ndata in the context of their event times, you cannot define those temporal\nboundaries using processing time (i.e., processing-time windowing), as many\nsystems do; with no consistent correlation between processing time and event\ntime, some of your event-time data are going to end up in the wrong\nprocessing-time windows (due to the inherent lag in distributed systems, the\nonline/offline nature of many types of input sources, etc.), throwing\ncorrectness out the window, as it were. We look at this problem in more\n5\ndetail in a number of examples in the sections that follow, as well as the\nremainder of the book.\nUnfortunately, the picture isn’t exactly rosy when windowing by event time,\neither. In the context of unbounded data, disorder and variable skew induce a\ncompleteness problem for event-time windows: lacking a predictable\nmapping between processing time and event time, how can you determine\nwhen you’ve observed all of the data for a given event time X? For many\nreal-world data sources, you simply can’t. But the vast majority of data\nprocessing systems in use today rely on some notion of completeness, which\nputs them at a severe disadvantage when applied to unbounded datasets.\nI propose that instead of attempting to groom unbounded data into finite\nbatches of information that eventually become complete, we should be\ndesigning tools that allow us to live in the world of uncertainty imposed by\nthese complex datasets. New data will arrive, old data might be retracted or\nupdated, and any system we build should be able to cope with these facts on\nits own, with notions of completeness being a convenient optimization for\nspecific and appropriate use cases rather than a semantic necessity across all\nof them.\nBefore getting into specifics about what such an approach might look like,\nlet’s finish up one more useful piece of background: common data processing\npatterns.\n"},"chapter1/section1.2.html":{"url":"chapter1/section1.2.html","title":"Section1.2 Data Processing Patterns","keywords":"","body":"Data Processing Patterns\nAt this point, we have enough background established that we can begin\nlooking at the core types of usage patterns common across bounded and\nunbounded data processing today. We look at both types of processing and,\nwhere relevant, within the context of the two main types of engines we care\nabout (batch and streaming, where in this context, I’m essentially lumping\nmicrobatch in with streaming because the differences between the two aren’t\nterribly important at this level).\nBounded Data\nProcessing bounded data is conceptually quite straightforward, and likely\nfamiliar to everyone. In Figure 1-2, we start out on the left with a dataset full\nof entropy. We run it through some data processing engine (typically batch,\nthough a well-designed streaming engine would work just as well), such as\nMapReduce, and on the right side end up with a new structured dataset with\ngreater inherent value.\nFigure 1-2. Bounded data processing with a classic batch engine. A finite pool of\nunstructured data on the left is run through a data processing engine, resulting in\ncorresponding structured data on the right.\nThough there are of course infinite variations on what you can actually\ncalculate as part of this scheme, the overall model is quite simple. Much more\ninteresting is the task of processing an unbounded dataset. Let’s now look at\nthe various ways unbounded data are typically processed, beginning with the\napproaches used with traditional batch engines and then ending up with the\napproaches you can take with a system designed for unbounded data, such as\nmost streaming or microbatch engines.\nUnbounded Data: Batch\nBatch engines, though not explicitly designed with unbounded data in mind,\nhave nevertheless been used to process unbounded datasets since batch\nsystems were first conceived. As you might expect, such approaches revolve\naround slicing up the unbounded data into a collection of bounded datasets\nappropriate for batch processing.\nFixed windows\nThe most common way to process an unbounded dataset using repeated runs\nof a batch engine is by windowing the input data into fixed-size windows and\nthen processing each of those windows as a separate, bounded data source\n(sometimes also called tumbling windows ), as in Figure 1-3. Particularly for\ninput sources like logs, for which events can be written into directory and file\nhierarchies whose names encode the window they correspond to, this sort of\nthing appears quite straightforward at first blush because you’ve essentially\nperformed the time-based shuffle to get data into the appropriate event-time\nwindows ahead of time.\nIn reality, however, most systems still have a completeness problem to deal\nwith (What if some of your events are delayed en route to the logs due to a\nnetwork partition? What if your events are collected globally and must be\ntransferred to a common location before processing? What if your events\ncome from mobile devices?), which means some sort of mitigation might be\nnecessary (e.g., delaying processing until you’re sure all events have been\ncollected or reprocessing the entire batch for a given window whenever data\narrive late).\nFigure 1-3. Unbounded data processing via ad hoc fixed windows with a classic batch\nengine. An unbounded dataset is collected up front into finite, fixed-size windows of\nbounded data that are then processed via successive runs a of classic batch engine.\nSessions\nThis approach breaks down even more when you try to use a batch engine to\nprocess unbounded data into more sophisticated windowing strategies, like\nsessions. Sessions are typically defined as periods of activity (e.g., for a\nspecific user) terminated by a gap of inactivity. When calculating sessions\nusing a typical batch engine, you often end up with sessions that are split\nacross batches, as indicated by the red marks in Figure 1-4. We can reduce\nthe number of splits by increasing batch sizes, but at the cost of increased\nlatency. Another option is to add additional logic to stitch up sessions from\nprevious runs, but at the cost of further complexity.\nFigure 1-4. Unbounded data processing into sessions via ad hoc fixed windows with a\nclassic batch engine. An unbounded dataset is collected up front into finite, fixed-size\nwindows of bounded data that are then subdivided into dynamic session windows via\nsuccessive runs a of classic batch engine.\nEither way, using a classic batch engine to calculate sessions is less than\nideal. A nicer way would be to build up sessions in a streaming manner,\nwhich we look at later on.\nUnbounded Data: Streaming\nContrary to the ad hoc nature of most batch-based unbounded data processing\napproaches, streaming systems are built for unbounded data. As we talked\nabout earlier, for many real-world, distributed input sources, you not only\nfind yourself dealing with unbounded data, but also data such as the\nfollowing:\nHighly unordered with respect to event times, meaning that you need\nsome sort of time-based shuffle in your pipeline if you want to\nanalyze the data in the context in which they occurred.\nOf varying event-time skew, meaning that you can’t just assume\nyou’ll always see most of the data for a given event time X within\nsome constant epsilon of time Y.\nThere are a handful of approaches that you can take when dealing with data\nthat have these characteristics. I generally categorize these approaches into\nfour groups: time-agnostic, approximation, windowing by processing time,\nand windowing by event time.\nLet’s now spend a little bit of time looking at each of these approaches.\nTime-agnostic\nTime-agnostic processing is used for cases in which time is essentially\nirrelevant; that is, all relevant logic is data driven. Because everything about\nsuch use cases is dictated by the arrival of more data, there’s really nothing\nspecial a streaming engine has to support other than basic data delivery. As a\nresult, essentially all streaming systems in existence support time-agnostic\nuse cases out of the box (modulo system-to-system variances in consistency\nguarantees, of course, if you care about correctness). Batch systems are also\nwell suited for time-agnostic processing of unbounded data sources by simply\nchopping the unbounded source into an arbitrary sequence of bounded\ndatasets and processing those datasets independently. We look at a couple of\nconcrete examples in this section, but given the straightforwardness of\nhandling time-agnostic processing (from a temporal perspective at least), we\nwon’t spend much more time on it beyond that.\nFiltering\nA very basic form of time-agnostic processing is filtering, an example of\nwhich is rendered in Figure 1-5. Imagine that you’re processing web traffic\nlogs and you want to filter out all traffic that didn’t originate from a specific\ndomain. You would look at each record as it arrived, see if it belonged to the\ndomain of interest, and drop it if not. Because this sort of thing depends only\non a single element at any time, the fact that the data source is unbounded,\nunordered, and of varying event-time skew is irrelevant.\nFigure 1-5. Filtering unbounded data. A collection of data (flowing left to right) of varying\ntypes is filtered into a homogeneous collection containing a single type.\nInner joins\nAnother time-agnostic example is an inner join, diagrammed in Figure 1-6.\nWhen joining two unbounded data sources, if you care only about the results\nof a join when an element from both sources arrive, there’s no temporal\nelement to the logic. Upon seeing a value from one source, you can simply\nbuffer it up in persistent state; only after the second value from the other\nsource arrives do you need to emit the joined record. (In truth, you’d likely\nwant some sort of garbage collection policy for unemitted partial joins, which\nwould likely be time based. But for a use case with little or no uncompleted\njoins, such a thing might not be an issue.)\nFigure 1-6. Performing an inner join on unbounded data. Joins are produced when\nmatching elements from both sources are observed.\nSwitching semantics to some sort of outer join introduces the data\ncompleteness problem we’ve talked about: after you’ve seen one side of the\njoin, how do you know whether the other side is ever going to arrive or not?\nTruth be told, you don’t, so you need to introduce some notion of a timeout,\nwhich introduces an element of time. That element of time is essentially a\nform of windowing, which we’ll look at more closely in a moment.\nApproximation algorithms\nThe second major category of approaches is approximation algorithms, such\nas approximate Top-N, streaming k-means, and so on. They take an\nunbounded source of input and provide output data that, if you squint at them,\nlook more or less like what you were hoping to get, as in Figure 1-7. The\nupside of approximation algorithms is that, by design, they are low overhead\nand designed for unbounded data. The downsides are that a limited set of\nthem exist, the algorithms themselves are often complicated (which makes it\ndifficult to conjure up new ones), and their approximate nature limits their\nutility.\nFigure 1-7. Computing approximations on unbounded data. Data are run through a\ncomplex algorithm, yielding output data that look more or less like the desired result on the\nother side.\nIt’s worth noting that these algorithms typically do have some element of\ntime in their design (e.g., some sort of built-in decay). And because they\nprocess elements as they arrive, that time element is usually processing-time\nbased. This is particularly important for algorithms that provide some sort of\nprovable error bounds on their approximations. If those error bounds are\npredicated on data arriving in order, they mean essentially nothing when you\nfeed the algorithm unordered data with varying event-time skew. Something\nto keep in mind.\nApproximation algorithms themselves are a fascinating subject, but as they\nare essentially another example of time-agnostic processing (modulo the\ntemporal features of the algorithms themselves), they’re quite straightforward\nto use and thus not worth further attention, given our current focus.\nWindowing\nThe remaining two approaches for unbounded data processing are both\nvariations of windowing. Before diving into the differences between them, I\nshould make it clear exactly what I mean by windowing, insomuch as we\ntouched on it only briefly in the previous section. Windowing is simply the\nnotion of taking a data source (either unbounded or bounded), and chopping\nit up along temporal boundaries into finite chunks for processing. Figure 1-8\nshows three different windowing patterns.\nFigure 1-8. Windowing strategies. Each example is shown for three different keys,\nhighlighting the difference between aligned windows (which apply across all the data) and\nunaligned windows (which apply across a subset of the data).\nLet’s take a closer look at each strategy:\nFixed windows (aka tumbling windows)\nWe discussed fixed windows earlier. Fixed windows slice time into\nsegments with a fixed-size temporal length. Typically (as shown in\nFigure 1-9), the segments for fixed windows are applied uniformly across\nthe entire dataset, which is an example of aligned windows. In some\ncases, it’s desirable to phase-shift the windows for different subsets of the\ndata (e.g., per key) to spread window completion load more evenly over\ntime, which instead is an example of unaligned windows because they\nvary across the data.\nSliding windows (aka hopping windows)\n6\nA generalization of fixed windows, sliding windows are defined by a\nfixed length and a fixed period. If the period is less than the length, the\nwindows overlap. If the period equals the length, you have fixed\nwindows. And if the period is greater than the length, you have a weird\nsort of sampling window that looks only at subsets of the data over time.\nAs with fixed windows, sliding windows are typically aligned, though\nthey can be unaligned as a performance optimization in certain use cases.\nNote that the sliding windows in Figure 1-8 are drawn as they are to give\na sense of sliding motion; in reality, all five windows would apply across\nthe entire dataset.\nSessions\nAn example of dynamic windows, sessions are composed of sequences of\nevents terminated by a gap of inactivity greater than some timeout.\nSessions are commonly used for analyzing user behavior over time, by\ngrouping together a series of temporally related events (e.g., a sequence\nof videos viewed in one sitting). Sessions are interesting because their\nlengths cannot be defined a priori; they are dependent upon the actual\ndata involved. They’re also the canonical example of unaligned windows\nbecause sessions are practically never identical across different subsets of\ndata (e.g., different users).\nThe two domains of time we discussed earlier (processing time and event\ntime) are essentially the two we care about. Windowing makes sense in both\ndomains, so let’s look at each in detail and see how they differ. Because\nprocessing-time windowing has historically been more common, we’ll start\nthere.\nWindowing by processing time\nWhen windowing by processing time, the system essentially buffers up\nincoming data into windows until some amount of processing time has\npassed. For example, in the case of five-minute fixed windows, the system\nwould buffer data for five minutes of processing time, after which it would\ntreat all of the data it had observed in those five minutes as a window and\nsend them downstream for processing.\n7\nFigure 1-9. Windowing into fixed windows by processing time. Data are collected into\nwindows based on the order they arrive in the pipeline.\nThere are a few nice properties of processing-time windowing:\nIt’s simple. The implementation is extremely straightforward\nbecause you never worry about shuffling data within time. You just\nbuffer things as they arrive and send them downstream when the\nwindow closes.\nJudging window completeness is straightforward. Because the\nsystem has perfect knowledge of whether all inputs for a window\nhave been seen, it can make perfect decisions about whether a given\nwindow is complete. This means there is no need to be able to deal\nwith “late” data in any way when windowing by processing time.\nIf you’re wanting to infer information about the source as it is\nobserved , processing-time windowing is exactly what you want.\nMany monitoring scenarios fall into this category. Imagine tracking\nthe number of requests per second sent to a global-scale web service.\nCalculating a rate of these requests for the purpose of detecting\noutages is a perfect use of processing-time windowing.\nGood points aside, there is one very big downside to processing-time\nwindowing: if the data in question have event times associated with them,\nthose data must arrive in event-time order if the processing-time windows are\nto reflect the reality of when those events actually happened. Unfortunately,\nevent-time ordered data are uncommon in many real-world, distributed input\nsources.\nAs a simple example, imagine any mobile app that gathers usage statistics for\nlater processing. For cases in which a given mobile device goes offline for\nany amount of time (brief loss of connectivity, airplane mode while flying\nacross the country, etc.), the data recorded during that period won’t be\nuploaded until the device comes online again. This means that data might\narrive with an event-time skew of minutes, hours, days, weeks, or more. It’s\nessentially impossible to draw any sort of useful inferences from such a\ndataset when windowed by processing time.\nAs another example, many distributed input sources might seem to provide\nevent-time ordered (or very nearly so) data when the overall system is\nhealthy. Unfortunately, the fact that event-time skew is low for the input\nsource when healthy does not mean it will always stay that way. Consider a\nglobal service that processes data collected on multiple continents. If network\nissues across a bandwidth-constrained transcontinental line (which, sadly, are\nsurprisingly common) further decrease bandwidth and/or increase latency,\nsuddenly a portion of your input data might begin arriving with much greater\nskew than before. If you are windowing those data by processing time, your\nwindows are no longer representative of the data that actually occurred within\nthem; instead, they represent the windows of time as the events arrived at the\nprocessing pipeline, which is some arbitrary mix of old and current data.\nWhat we really want in both of those cases is to window data by their event\ntimes in a way that is robust to the order of arrival of events. What we really\nwant is event-time windowing.\nWindowing by event time\nEvent-time windowing is what you use when you need to observe a data\nsource in finite chunks that reflect the times at which those events actually\nhappened. It’s the gold standard of windowing. Prior to 2016, most data\nprocessing systems in use lacked native support for it (though any system\nwith a decent consistency model, like Hadoop or Spark Streaming 1.x, could\nact as a reasonable substrate for building such a windowing system). I’m\nhappy to say that the world of today looks very different, with multiple\nsystems, from Flink to Spark to Storm to Apex, natively supporting event-\ntime windowing of some sort.\nFigure 1-10 shows an example of windowing an unbounded source into one-\nhour fixed windows.\nFigure 1-10. Windowing into fixed windows by event time. Data are collected into windows\nbased on the times at which they occurred. The black arrows call out example data that\narrived in processing-time windows that differed from the event-time windows to which\nthey belonged.\nThe black arrows in Figure 1-10 call out two particularly interesting pieces of\ndata. Each arrived in processing-time windows that did not match the event-\ntime windows to which each bit of data belonged. As such, if these data had\nbeen windowed into processing-time windows for a use case that cared about\nevent times, the calculated results would have been incorrect. As you would\nexpect, event-time correctness is one nice thing about using event-time\nwindows.\nAnother nice thing about event-time windowing over an unbounded data\nsource is that you can create dynamically sized windows, such as sessions,\nwithout the arbitrary splits observed when generating sessions over fixed\nwindows (as we saw previously in the sessions example from “Unbounded\nData: Streaming”), as demonstrated in Figure 1-11.\nFigure 1-11. Windowing into session windows by event time. Data are collected into\nsession windows capturing bursts of activity based on the times that the corresponding\nevents occurred. The black arrows again call out the temporal shuffle necessary to put the\ndata into their correct event-time locations.\nOf course, powerful semantics rarely come for free, and event-time windows\nare no exception. Event-time windows have two notable drawbacks due to\nthe fact that windows must often live longer (in processing time) than the\nactual length of the window itself:\nBuffering\nDue to extended window lifetimes, more buffering of data is required.\nThankfully, persistent storage is generally the cheapest of the resource\ntypes most data processing systems depend on (the others being primarily\nCPU, network bandwidth, and RAM). As such, this problem is typically\nmuch less of a concern than you might think when using any well-\ndesigned data processing system with strongly consistent persistent state\nand a decent in-memory caching layer. Also, many useful aggregations\ndo not require the entire input set to be buffered (e.g., sum or average),\nbut instead can be performed incrementally, with a much smaller,\nintermediate aggregate stored in persistent state.\nCompleteness\nGiven that we often have no good way of knowing when we’ve seen all\nof the data for a given window, how do we know when the results for the\nwindow are ready to materialize? In truth, we simply don’t. For many\ntypes of inputs, the system can give a reasonably accurate heuristic\nestimate of window completion via something like the watermarks found\nin MillWheel, Cloud Dataflow, and Flink (which we talk about more in\nChapters 3 and 4 ). But for cases in which absolute correctness is\nparamount (again, think billing), the only real option is to provide a way\nfor the pipeline builder to express when they want results for windows to\nbe materialized and how those results should be refined over time.\nDealing with window completeness (or lack thereof) is a fascinating topic\nbut one perhaps best explored in the context of concrete examples, which\nwe look at next.\n"},"chapter2/":{"url":"chapter2/","title":"Chapter2 The What, Where,When, and How of Data Processing","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2. The What , Where ,\nWhen , and How of Data\nProcessing\nOkay party people, it’s time to get concrete!\nChapter 1 focused on three main areas: terminology , defining precisely what I\nmean when I use overloaded terms like “streaming”; batch versus streaming ,\ncomparing the theoretical capabilities of the two types of systems, and\npostulating that only two things are necessary to take streaming systems\nbeyond their batch counterparts: correctness and tools for reasoning about\ntime; and data processing patterns , looking at the conceptual approaches\ntaken with both batch and streaming systems when processing bounded and\nunbounded data.\nIn this chapter, we’re now going to focus further on the data processing\npatterns from Chapter 1, but in more detail, and within the context of\nconcrete examples. By the time we’re finished, we’ll have covered what I\nconsider to be the core set of principles and concepts required for robust out-\nof-order data processing; these are the tools for reasoning about time that\ntruly get you beyond classic batch processing.\nTo give you a sense of what things look like in action, I use snippets of\nApache Beam code, coupled with time-lapse diagrams to provide a visual\nrepresentation of the concepts. Apache Beam is a unified programming\nmodel and portability layer for batch and stream processing, with a set of\nconcrete SDKs in various languages (e.g., Java and Python). Pipelines written\nwith Apache Beam can then be portably run on any of the supported\nexecution engines (Apache Apex, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Cloud\nDataflow, etc.).\nI use Apache Beam here for examples not because this is a Beam book (it’s\n1\nnot), but because it most completely embodies the concepts described in this\nbook. Back when “Streaming 102” was originally written (back when it was\nstill the Dataflow Model from Google Cloud Dataflow and not the Beam\nModel from Apache Beam), it was literally the only system in existence that\nprovided the amount of expressiveness necessary for all the examples we’ll\ncover here. A year and a half later, I’m happy to say much has changed, and\nmost of the major systems out there have moved or are moving toward\nsupporting a model that looks a lot like the one described in this book. So rest\nassured that the concepts we cover here, though informed through the Beam\nlens, as it were, will apply equally across most other systems you’ll come\nacross.\n"},"INTRODUCTION.html":{"url":"INTRODUCTION.html","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Printed in the United States of America.\nPublished by O’Reilly Media, Inc., 1005 Gravenstein Highway North,\nSebastopol, CA 95472.\nO’Reilly books may be purchased for educational, business, or sales\npromotional use.

At this point, I assume that\nyou’re either interested in learning more about the wonders of stream\nprocessing or hoping to spend a few hours reading about the glory of the\nmajestic brown trout. Either way, I salute you! That said, those of you in the\nlatter bucket who don’t also have an advanced understanding of computer\nscience should consider how prepared you are to deal with disappointment\nbefore forging ahead; caveat piscator , and all that.\nTo set the tone for this book from the get go, I wanted to give you a heads up\nabout a couple of things. First, this book is a little strange in that we have\nmultiple authors, but we’re not pretending that we somehow all speak and\nwrite in the same voice like we’re weird identical triplets who happened to be\nborn to different sets of parents. Because as interesting as that sounds, the end\nresult would actually be less enjoyable to read. Instead, we’ve opted to each\nwrite in our own voices, and we’ve granted the book just enough self-\nawareness to be able to make reference to each of us where appropriate, but\nnot so much self-awareness that it resents us for making it only into a book\nand not something cooler like a robot dinosaur with a Scottish accent.\nAs far as voices go, there are three you’ll come across:\nTyler\nThat would be me. If you haven’t explicitly been told someone else is\nspeaking, you can assume that it’s me, because we added the other\nauthors somewhat late in the game, and I was basically like, “hells no”\nwhen I thought about going back and updating everything I’d already\nwritten. I’m the technical lead for the Data Processing Languages ands\nSystems group at Google, responsible for Google Cloud Dataflow,\nGoogle’s Apache Beam efforts, as well as Google-internal data\n1\n2\nprocessing systems such as Flume, MillWheel, and MapReduce. I’m also\na founding Apache Beam PMC member.\nFigure P-1. The cover that could have been...\nSlava\nSlava was a long-time member of the MillWheel team at Google, and\nlater an original member of the Windmill team that built MillWheel’s\nsuccessor, the heretofore unnamed system that powers the Streaming\nEngine in Google Cloud Dataflow. Slava is the foremost expert on\nwatermarks and time semantics in stream processing systems the world\nover, period. You might find it unsurprising then that he’s the author of\nChapter 3, Watermarks.\nReuven\nReuven is at the bottom of this list because he has more experience with\nstream processing than both Slava and me combined and would thus\ncrush us if he were placed any higher. Reuven has created or led the\ncreation of nearly all of the interesting systems-level magic in Google’s\ngeneral-purpose stream processing engines, including applying an untold\namount of attention to detail in providing high-throughput, low-latency,\nexactly-once semantics in a system that nevertheless utilizes fine-grained\ncheckpointing. You might find it unsurprising that he’s the author of\nChapter 5, Exactly-Once and Side Effects. He also happens to be an\nApache Beam PMC member.\nNavigating This Book\nNow that you know who you’ll be hearing from, the next logical step would\nbe to find out what you’ll be hearing about, which brings us to the second\nthing I wanted to mention. There are conceptually two major parts to this\nbook, each with four chapters, and each followed up by a chapter that stands\nrelatively independently on its own.\nThe fun begins with Part I, The Beam Model (Chapters 1 – 4 ), which focuses\non the high-level batch plus streaming data processing model originally\ndeveloped for Google Cloud Dataflow, later donated to the Apache Software\nFoundation as Apache Beam, and also now seen in whole or in part across\nmost other systems in the industry. It’s composed of four chapters:\nChapter 1, Streaming 101 , which covers the basics of stream\nprocessing, establishing some terminology, discussing the\ncapabilities of streaming systems, distinguishing between two\nimportant domains of time (processing time and event time), and\nfinally looking at some common data processing patterns.\nChapter 2, The What, Where, When, and How of Data Processing ,\nwhich covers in detail the core concepts of robust stream processing\nover out-of-order data, each analyzed within the context of a\nconcrete running example and with animated diagrams to highlight\nthe dimension of time.\nChapter 3, Watermarks (written by Slava), which provides a deep\nsurvey of temporal progress metrics, how they are created, and how\nthey propagate through pipelines. It ends by examining the details of\ntwo real-world watermark implementations.\nChapter 4, Advanced Windowing , which picks up where Chapter 2\nleft off, diving into some advanced windowing and triggering\nconcepts like processing-time windows, sessions, and continuation\ntriggers.\nBetween Parts I and II, providing an interlude as timely as the details\ncontained therein are important, stands Chapter 5, Exactly-Once and Side\nEffects (written by Reuven). In it, he enumerates the challenges of providing\nend-to-end exactly-once (or effectively-once) processing semantics and walks\nthrough the implementation details of three different approaches to exactly-\nonce processing: Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.\nNext begins Part II, Streams and Tables (Chapters 6 – 9 ), which dives deeper\ninto the conceptual and investigates the lower-level “streams and tables” way\nof thinking about stream processing, recently popularized by some\nupstanding citizens in the Apache Kafka community but, of course, invented\ndecades ago by folks in the database community, because wasn’t everything?\nIt too is composed of four chapters:\nChapter 6, Streams and Tables , which introduces the basic idea of\nstreams and tables, analyzes the classic MapReduce approach\nthrough a streams-and-tables lens, and then constructs a theory of\nstreams and tables sufficiently general to encompass the full breadth\nof the Beam Model (and beyond).\nChapter 7, The Practicalities of Persistent State , which considers the\nmotivations for persistent state in streaming pipelines, looks at two\ncommon types of implicit state, and then analyzes a practical use\ncase (advertising attribution) to inform the necessary characteristics\nof a general state management mechanism.\nChapter 8, Streaming SQL , which investigates the meaning of\nstreaming within the context of relational algebra and SQL, contrasts\nthe inherent stream and table biases within the Beam Model and\nclassic SQL as they exist today, and proposes a set of possible paths\nforward toward incorporating robust streaming semantics in SQL.\nChapter 9, Streaming Joins , which surveys a variety of different join\ntypes, analyzes their behavior within the context of streaming, and\nfinally looks in detail at a useful but ill-supported streaming join use\ncase: temporal validity windows.\nFinally, closing out the book is Chapter 10, The Evolution of Large-Scale\nData Processing , which strolls through a focused history of the MapReduce\nlineage of data processing systems, examining some of the important\ncontributions that have evolved streaming systems into what they are today.\nTakeaways\nAs a final bit of guidance, if you were to ask me to describe the things I most\nwant readers to take away from this book, I would say this:\nThe single most important thing you can learn from this book is the\ntheory of streams and tables and how they relate to one another.\nEverything else builds on top of that. No, we won’t get to this topic\nuntil Chapter 6. That’s okay; it’s worth the wait, and you’ll be better\nprepared to appreciate its awesomeness by then.\nTime-varying relations are a revelation. They are stream processing\nincarnate: an embodiment of everything streaming systems are built\nto achieve and a powerful connection to the familiar tools we all\nknow and love from the world of batch. We won’t learn about them\nuntil Chapter 8, but again, the journey there will help you appreciate\nthem all the more.\nA well-written distributed streaming engine is a magical thing. This\narguably goes for distributed systems in general, but as you learn\nmore about how these systems are built to provide the semantics\nthey do (in particular, the case studies from Chapters 3 and 5 ), it\nbecomes all the more apparent just how much heavy lifting they’re\ndoing for you.\nLaTeX/Tikz is an amazing tool for making diagrams, animated or\notherwise. A horrible, crusty tool with sharp edges and tetanus, but\nan incredible tool nonetheless. I hope the clarity the animated\ndiagrams in this book bring to the complex topics we discuss will\ninspire more people to give LaTeX/Tikz a try (in “Figures”, we\nprovide for a link to the full source for the animations from this\nbook).\nConventions Used in This Book\nThe following typographical conventions are used in this book:\nItalic\nIndicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, and file\nextensions.\nConstant width\nUsed for program listings, as well as within paragraphs to refer to\nprogram elements such as variable or function names, databases, data\ntypes, environment variables, statements, and keywords.\nConstant width bold\nShows commands or other text that should be typed literally by the user.\nConstant width italic\nShows text that should be replaced with user-supplied values or by values\ndetermined by context.\nTIP\nThis element signifies a tip or suggestion.\nNOTE\nThis element signifies a general note.\nWARNING\nThis element indicates a warning or caution.\nOnline Resources\nThere are a handful of associated online resources to aid in your enjoyment of\nthis book.\nFigures\nAll the of the figures in this book are available in digital form on the book’s\nwebsite. This is particularly useful for the animated figures, only a few\nframes of which appear (comic-book style) in the non-Safari formats of the\nbook:\nOnline index: http://www.streamingbook.net/figures\nSpecific figures may be referenced at URLs of the form:\nhttp://www.streamingbook.net/fig/\nFor example, for Figure 2-5: http://www.streamingbook.net/fig/2-\nThe animated figures themselves are LaTeX/Tikz drawings, rendered first to\nPDF, then converted to animated GIFs via ImageMagick. For the more\nintrepid among you, full source code and instructions for rendering the\nanimations (from this book, the “Streaming 101” and “Streaming 102” blog\nposts, and the original Dataflow Model paper) are available on GitHub at\nhttp://github.com/takidau/animations. Be warned that this is roughly 14,\nlines of LaTeX/Tikz code that grew very organically, with no intent of ever\nbeing read and used by others. In other words, it’s a messy, intertwined web\nof archaic incantations; turn back now or abandon all hope ye who enter here,\nfor there be dragons.\nCode Snippets\nAlthough this book is largely conceptual, there are are number of code and\npsuedo-code snippets used throughout to help illustrate points. Code for the\nmore functional core Beam Model concepts from Chapters 2 and 4 , as well as\nthe more imperative state and timers concepts in Chapter 7, is available\nonline at http://github.com/takidau/streamingbook. Since understanding\nsemantics is the main goal, the code is provided primarily as Beam\nPTransform/DoFn implementations and accompanying unit tests. There is\nalso a single standalone pipeline implementation to illustrate the delta\nbetween a unit test and a real pipeline. The code layout is as follows:\nsrc/main/java/net/streamingbook/BeamModel.java\nBeam PTransform implementations of Examples 2-1 through 2-9 and\nExample 4-3, each with an additional method returning the expected\noutput when executed over the example datasets from those chapters.\nsrc/test/java/net/streamingbook/BeamModelTest.java\nUnit tests verifying the example PTransforms in BeamModel.java via\ngenerated datasets matching those in the book.\nsrc/main/java/net/streamingbook/Example2_1.java\nStandalone version of the Example 2-1 pipeline that can be run locally or\nusing a distributed Beam runner.\nsrc/main/java/net/streamingbook/inputs.csv\nSample input file for Example2_1.java containing the dataset from the\nbook.\nsrc/main/java/net/streamingbook/StateAndTimers.java\nBeam code implementing the conversion attribution example from\nChapter 7 using Beam’s state and timers primitives.\nsrc/test/java/net/streamingbook/StateAndTimersTest.java\nUnit test verifying the conversion attribution DoFns from\nStateAndTimers.java.\nsrc/main/java/net/streamingbook/ValidityWindows.java\nTemporal validity windows implementation.\nsrc/main/java/net/streamingbook/Utils.java\nShared utility methods.\nThis book is here to help you get your job done.

Without their vision and skill, the world of\nmassive-scale stream processing would look very different.\nCraig Chambers, Frances Perry, Robert Bradshaw, Ashish Raniwala,\nand the rest of the Flume team of yore for envisioning and creating\nthe expressive and powerful data processing foundation that we were\nlater able to unify with the world of streaming.\nSam McVeety for lead authoring the original MillWheel paper,\nwhich put our amazing little project on the map for the very first\ntime.\nGrzegorz Czajkowski for repeatedly supporting our evangelization\nefforts, even as competing deadlines and priorities loomed.\nLooking more broadly, a huge amount of credit is due to everyone in the\nApache Beam, Calcite, Kafka, Flink, Spark, and Storm communities. Each\nand every one of these projects has contributed materially to advancing the\nstate of the art in stream processing for the world at large over the past\ndecade. Thank you.\nTo shower gratitude a bit more specifically, we would also like to thank:\nMartin Kleppmann, for leading the charge in advocating for the\nstreams-and-tables way of thinking, and also for investing a huge\namount of time providing piles of insightful technical and editorial\ninput on the drafts of every chapter in this book. All this in addition\nto being an inspiration and all-around great guy.\nJulian Hyde, for his insightful vision and infectious passion for\nstreaming SQL.\nJay Kreps, for fighting the good fight against Lambda Architecture\ntyranny; it was your original “Questioning the Lambda Architecture”\npost that got Tyler pumped enough to go out and join the fray, as\nwell.\nStephan Ewen, Kostas Tzoumas, Fabian Hueske, Aljoscha Krettek,\nRobert Metzger, Kostas Kloudas, Jamie Grier, Max Michels, and the\nrest of the data Artisans extended family, past and present, for\nalways pushing the envelope of what’s possible in stream\nprocessing, and doing so in a consistently open and collaborative\nway.

It’s been a joy writing it all down, and we’ve done\nour best to make sure you’ll get your money’s worth. If for some reason you\ndon’t like it...well hopefully you bought the print edition so you can at least\nthrow it across the room in disgust before you sell it at a used bookstore.\nWatch out for the cat.\nWhich incidentally is what we requested our animal book cover be, but\nO’Reilly felt it wouldn’t translate well into line art. I respectfully disagree,\nbut a brown trout is a fair compromise.\nOr DataPLS, pronounced Datapals—get it?\nOr don’t. I actually don’t like cats.\n3\n1\n2\n3\n"},"chapter1/summary.html":{"url":"chapter1/summary.html","title":"Summary","keywords":"","body":"Summary\nWhew! That was a lot of information. If you’ve made it this far, you are to be\ncommended! But we are only just getting started. Before forging ahead to\nlooking in detail at the Beam Model approach, let’s briefly step back and\nrecap what we’ve learned so far. In this chapter, we’ve done the following:\nClarified terminology, focusing the definition of “streaming” to refer\nto systems built with unbounded data in mind, while using more\ndescriptive terms like approximate/speculative results for distinct\nconcepts often categorized under the “streaming” umbrella.\nAdditionally, we highlighted two important dimensions of large-\nscale datasets: cardinality (i.e., bounded versus unbounded) and\nencoding (i.e., table versus stream), the latter of which will consume\nmuch of the second half of the book.\nAssessed the relative capabilities of well-designed batch and\nstreaming systems, positing streaming is in fact a strict superset of\nbatch, and that notions like the Lambda Architecture, which are\npredicated on streaming being inferior to batch, are destined for\nretirement as streaming systems mature.\nProposed two high-level concepts necessary for streaming systems\nto both catch up to and ultimately surpass batch, those being\ncorrectness and tools for reasoning about time, respectively.\nEstablished the important differences between event time and\nprocessing time, characterized the difficulties those differences\nimpose when analyzing data in the context of when they occurred,\nand proposed a shift in approach away from notions of completeness\nand toward simply adapting to changes in data over time.\nLooked at the major data processing approaches in common use\ntoday for bounded and unbounded data, via both batch and streaming\nengines, roughly categorizing the unbounded approaches into: time-\nagnostic, approximation, windowing by processing time, and\nwindowing by event time.\nNext up, we dive into the details of the Beam Model, taking a conceptual\nlook at how we’ve broken up the notion of data processing across four related\naxes: what, where, when, and how. We also take a detailed look at processing\na simple, concrete example dataset across multiple scenarios, highlighting the\nplurality of use cases enabled by the Beam Model, with some concrete APIs\nto ground us in reality. These examples will help drive home the notions of\nevent time and processing time introduced in this chapter while additionally\nexploring new concepts such as watermarks.\nFor completeness, it’s perhaps worth calling out that this definition includes\nboth true streaming as well as microbatch implementations. For those of you\nwho aren’t familiar with microbatch systems, they are streaming systems that\nuse repeated executions of a batch processing engine to process unbounded\ndata. Spark Streaming is the canonical example in the industry.\nReaders familiar with my original “Streaming 101” article might recall that\nI rather emphatically encouraged the abandonment of the term “stream” when\nreferring to datasets. That never caught on, which I initially thought was due\nto its catchiness and pervasive existing usage. In retrospect, however, I think\nI was simply wrong. There actually is great value in distinguishing between\nthe two different types of dataset constitutions: tables and streams. Indeed,\nmost of the second half of this book is dedicated to understanding the\nrelationship between those two.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with what I mean when I say exactly-once , it’s referring\n1\n2\n3\nto a specific type of consistency guarantee that certain data processing\nframeworks provide. Consistency guarantees are typically bucketed into three\nmain classes: at-most-once processing, at-least-once processing, and exactly-\nonce processing. Note that the names in use here refer to the effective\nsemantics as observed within the outputs generated by the pipeline, not the\nactual number of times a pipeline might process (or attempt to process) any\ngiven record. For this reason, the term effectively-once is sometimes used\ninstead of exactly-once, since it’s more representative of the underlying\nnature of things. Reuven covers these concepts in much more detail in\nChapter 5.\nSince the original publication of “Streaming 101,” numerous individuals\nhave pointed out to me that it would have been more intuitive to place\nprocessing time on the x-axis and event time on the y-axis. I do agree that\nswapping the two axes would initially feel more natural, as event time seems\nlike the dependent variable to processing time’s independent variable.\nHowever, because both variables are monotonic and intimately related,\nthey’re effectively interdependent variables. So I think from a technical\nperspective you just have to pick an axis and stick with it. Math is confusing\n(especially outside of North America, where it suddenly becomes plural and\ngangs up on you).\nThis result really shouldn’t be surprising (but was for me, hence why I’m\npointing it out), because we’re effectively creating a right triangle with the\nideal line when measuring the two types of skew/lag. Maths are cool.\nWe look at aligned fixed windows in detail in Chapter 2, and unaligned\nfixed windows in Chapter 4.\nIf you poke around enough in the academic literature or SQL-based\nstreaming systems, you’ll also come across a third windowing time domain:\ntuple-based windowing (i.e., windows whose sizes are counted in numbers of\nelements). However, tuple-based windowing is essentially a form of\nprocessing-time windowing in which elements are assigned monotonically\nincreasing timestamps as they arrive at the system. As such, we won’t discuss\ntuple-based windowing in detail any further.\n4\n5\n6\n7\n"},"chapter2/section1.2.html":{"url":"chapter2/section1.2.html","title":"Section2.2 Batch Foundations: What and Where","keywords":"","body":"Batch Foundations: What and Where\nOkay, let’s get this party started. First stop: batch processing.\nWhat : Transformations\nThe transformations applied in classic batch processing answer the question:\n“ What results are calculated?” Even though you are likely already familiar\nwith classic batch processing, we’re going to start there anyway because it’s\nthe foundation on top of which we add all of the other concepts.\nIn the rest of this chapter (and indeed, through much of the book), we look at\na single example: computing keyed integer sums over a simple dataset\nconsisting of nine values. Let’s imagine that we’ve written a team-based\nmobile game and we want to build a pipeline that calculates team scores by\nsumming up the individual scores reported by users’ phones. If we were to\ncapture our nine example scores in a SQL table named “UserScores,” it might\nlook something like this:\n------------------------------------------------\n| Name | Team | Score | EventTime | ProcTime |\n------------------------------------------------\n| Julie | TeamX | 5   | 12:00:26 | 12:05:19 |\n| Frank | TeamX | 9   | 12:01:26 | 12:08:19 |\n| Ed    | TeamX | 7   | 12:02:26 | 12:05:39 |\n| Julie | TeamX | 8   | 12:03:06 | 12:07:06 |\n| Amy   | TeamX | 3   | 12:03:39 | 12:06:13 |\n2\n| Fred | TeamX | 4 | 12:04:19 | 12:06:39 |\n| Naomi | TeamX | 3 | 12:06:39 | 12:07:19 |\n| Becky | TeamX | 8 | 12:07:26 | 12:08:39 |\n| Naomi | TeamX | 1 | 12:07:46 | 12:09:00 |\n------------------------------------------------\nNote that all the scores in this example are from users on the same team; this\nis to keep the example simple, given that we have a limited number of\ndimensions in our diagrams that follow. And because we’re grouping by\nteam, we really just care about the last three columns:\nScore\nThe individual user score associated with this event\nEventTime\nThe event time for the score; that is, the time at which the score occurred\nProcTime\nThe processing for the score; that is, the time at which the score was\nobserved by the pipeline\nFor each example pipeline, we’ll look at a time-lapse diagram that highlights\nhow the data evolves over time. Those diagrams plot our nine scores in the\ntwo dimensions of time we care about: event time in the x-axis, and\nprocessing time in the y-axis. Figure 2-1 illustrates what a static plot of the\ninput data looks like.\nFigure 2-1. Nine input records, plotted in both event time and processing time\nSubsequent time-lapse diagrams are either animations (Safari) or a sequence\nof frames (print and all other digital formats), allowing you to see how the\ndata are processed over time (more on this shortly after we get to the first\ntime-lapse diagram).\nPreceding each example is a short snippet of Apache Beam Java SDK\npseudocode to make the definition of the pipeline more concrete. It is\npseudocode in the sense that I sometime bend the rules to make the examples\nclearer, elide details (like the use of concrete I/O sources), or simplify names\n(the trigger names in Beam Java 2.x and earlier are painfully verbose; I use\nsimpler names for clarity). Beyond minor things like those, it’s otherwise\nreal-world Beam code (and real code is available on GitHub for all examples\nin this chapter).\nIf you’re already familiar with something like Spark or Flink, you should\nhave a relatively easy time understanding what the Beam code is doing. But\nto give you a crash course in things, there are two basic primitives in Beam:\nPCollections\nThese represent datasets (possibly massive ones) across which parallel\ntransformations can be performed (hence the “P” at the beginning of the\nname).\nPTransforms\nThese are applied to PCollections to create new PCollections.\nPTransforms may perform element-wise transformations, they may\ngroup/aggregate multiple elements together, or they may be a composite\ncombination of other PTransforms, as depicted in Figure 2-2.\nFigure 2-2. Types of transformations\nFor the purposes of our examples, we typically assume that we start out with\na pre-loaded PCollection> named “input” (that is, a\nPCollection composed of key/value pairs of Teams and Integers, where\nthe Teams are just something like Strings representing team names, and the\nIntegers are scores from any individual on the corresponding team). In a\nreal-world pipeline, we would’ve acquired input by reading in a\nPCollection of raw data (e.g., log records) from an I/O source and\nthen transforming it into a PCollection> by parsing\nthe log records into appropriate key/value pairs. For the sake of clarity in this\nfirst example, I include pseudocode for all of those steps, but in subsequent\nexamples, I elide the I/O and parsing.\nThus, for a pipeline that simply reads in data from an I/O source, parses\nteam/score pairs, and calculates per-team sums of scores, we’d have\nsomething like that shown in Example 2-1.\nExample 2-1. Summation pipeline\nPCollection raw = IO.read(...);\nPCollection> input = raw.apply(new ParseFn());\nPCollection> totals =\ninput.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\nKey/value data are read from an I/O source, with a Team (e.g., String of the\nteam name) as the key and an Integer (e.g., individual team member scores)\nas the value. The values for each key are then summed together to generate\nper-key sums (e.g., total team score) in the output collection.\nFor all the examples to come, after seeing a code snippet describing the\npipeline that we’re analyzing, we’ll then look at a time-lapse diagram\nshowing the execution of that pipeline over our concrete dataset for a single\nkey. In a real pipeline, you can imagine that similar operations would be\nhappening in parallel across multiple machines, but for the sake of our\nexamples, it will be clearer to keep things simple.\nAs noted previously, Safari editions present the complete execution as an\nanimated movie, whereas print and all other digital formats use a static\nsequence of key frames that provide a sense of how the pipeline progresses\nover time. In both cases, we also provide a URL to a fully animated version\non http://www.streamingbook.net.\nEach diagram plots the inputs and outputs across two dimensions: event time\n(on the x-axis) and processing time (on the y-axis). Thus, real time as\nobserved by the pipeline progresses from bottom to top, as indicated by the\nthick horizontal black line that ascends in the processing-time axis as time\nprogresses. Inputs are circles, with the number inside the circle representing\nthe value of that specific record. They start out light gray, and darken as the\npipeline observes them.\nAs the pipeline observes values, it accumulates them in its intermediate state\nand eventually materializes the aggregate results as output. State and output\nare represented by rectangles (gray for state, blue for output), with the\naggregate value near the top, and with the area covered by the rectangle\nrepresenting the portions of event time and processing time accumulated into\nthe result. For the pipeline in Example 2-1, it would look something like that\nshown in Figure 2-3 when executed on a classic batch engine.\nFigure 2-3. Classic batch processing\nBecause this is a batch pipeline, it accumulates state until it’s seen all of the\ninputs (represented by the dashed green line at the top), at which point it\nproduces its single output of 48. In this example, we’re calculating a sum\nover all of event time because we haven’t applied any specific windowing\ntransformations; hence the rectangles for state and output cover the entirety\nof the x-axis. If we want to process an unbounded data source, however,\nclassic batch processing won’t be sufficient; we can’t wait for the input to\nend, because it effectively never will. One of the concepts we want is\nwindowing, which we introduced in Chapter 1. Thus, within the context of\nour second question—“ Where in event time are results calculated?”—we’ll\nnow briefly revisit windowing.\nWhere : Windowing\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, windowing is the process of slicing up a data\n00:00 / 00:00\nsource along temporal boundaries. Common windowing strategies include\nfixed windows, sliding windows, and sessions windows, as demonstrated in\nFigure 2-4.\nFigure 2-4. Example windowing strategies. Each example is shown for three different keys,\nhighlighting the difference between aligned windows (which apply across all the data) and\nunaligned windows (which apply across a subset of the data).\nTo get a better sense of what windowing looks like in practice, let’s take our\ninteger summation pipeline and window it into fixed, two-minute windows.\nWith Beam, the change is a simple addition of a Window.into transform,\nwhich you can see highlighted in Example 2-2.\nExample 2-2. Windowed summation code\nPCollection> totals = input\n.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES)))\n.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\nRecall that Beam provides a unified model that works in both batch and\nstreaming because semantically batch is really just a subset of streaming. As\nsuch, let’s first execute this pipeline on a batch engine; the mechanics are\nmore straightforward, and it will give us something to directly compare\nagainst when we switch to a streaming engine. Figure 2-5 presents the result.\nFigure 2-5. Windowed summation on a batch engine\nAs before, inputs are accumulated in state until they are entirely consumed,\nafter which output is produced. In this case, however, instead of one output,\nwe get four: a single output, for each of the four relevant two-minute event-\ntime windows.\nAt this point we’ve revisited the two main concepts that I introduced in\nChapter 1: the relationship between the event-time and processing-time\ndomains, and windowing. If we want to go any further, we’ll need to start\nadding the new concepts mentioned at the beginning of this section: triggers,\nwatermarks, and accumulation.\n"},"chapter2/summary0.html":{"url":"chapter2/summary0.html","title":"Going Streaming: When and How","keywords":"","body":"Going Streaming: When and How\nWe just observed the execution of a windowed pipeline on a batch engine.\nBut, ideally, we’d like to have lower latency for our results, and we’d also\nlike to natively handle unbounded data sources. Switching to a streaming\nengine is a step in the right direction, but our previous strategy of waiting\nuntil our input has been consumed in its entirety to generate output is no\nlonger feasible. Enter triggers and watermarks.\nWhen : The Wonderful Thing About Triggers Is\nTriggers Are Wonderful Things!\nTriggers provide the answer to the question: “ When in processing time are\nresults materialized?” Triggers declare when output for a window should\nhappen in processing time (though the triggers themselves might make those\ndecisions based on things that happen in other time domains, such as\n00:00 / 00:00\nwatermarks progressing in the event-time domain, as we’ll see in a few\nmoments). Each specific output for a window is referred to as a pane of the\nwindow.\nThough it’s possible to imagine quite a breadth of possible triggering\nsemantics, conceptually there are only two generally useful types of triggers,\nand practical applications almost always boil down using either one or a\ncombination of both:\nRepeated update triggers\nThese periodically generate updated panes for a window as its contents\nevolve. These updates can be materialized with every new record, or they\ncan happen after some processing-time delay, such as once a minute. The\nchoice of period for a repeated update trigger is primarily an exercise in\nbalancing latency and cost.\nCompleteness triggers\nThese materialize a pane for a window only after the input for that\nwindow is believed to be complete to some threshold. This type of trigger\nis most analogous to what we’re familiar with in batch processing: only\nafter the input is complete do we provide a result. The difference in the\ntrigger-based approach is that the notion of completeness is scoped to the\ncontext of a single window, rather than always being bound to the\ncompleteness of the entire input.\nRepeated update triggers are the most common type of trigger encountered in\nstreaming systems. They are simple to implement and simple to understand,\nand they provide useful semantics for a specific type of use case: repeated\n(and eventually consistent) updates to a materialized dataset, analogous to the\nsemantics you get with materialized views in the database world.\nCompleteness triggers are less frequently encountered, but provide streaming\nsemantics that more closely align with those from the classic batch\nprocessing world. They also provide tools for reasoning about things like\nmissing data and late data, both of which we discuss shortly (and in the next\nchapter) as we explore the underlying primitive that drives completeness\n3\ntriggers: watermarks.\nBut first, let’s start simple and look at some basic repeated update triggers in\naction. To make the notion of triggers a bit more concrete, let’s go ahead and\nadd the most straightforward type of trigger to our example pipeline: a trigger\nthat fires with every new record, as shown in Example 2-3.\nExample 2-3. Triggering repeatedly with every record\nPCollection> totals = input\n.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES))\n.triggering(Repeatedly(AfterCount(1))));\n.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\nIf we were to run this new pipeline on a streaming engine, the results would\nlook something like that shown in Figure 2-6.\nFigure 2-6. Per-record triggering on a streaming engine\nYou can see how we now get multiple outputs (panes) for each window: once\nper corresponding input. This sort of triggering pattern works well when the\noutput stream is being written to some sort of table that you can simply poll\nfor results. Any time you look in the table, you’ll see the most up-to-date\nvalue for a given window, and those values will converge toward correctness\nover time.\nOne downside of per-record triggering is that it’s quite chatty. When\nprocessing large-scale data, aggregations like summation provide a nice\nopportunity to reduce the cardinality of the stream without losing\ninformation. This is particularly noticeable for cases in which you have high-\nvolume keys; for our example, massive teams with lots of active players.\nImagine a massively multiplayer game in which players are split into one of\n00:00 / 00:00\ntwo factions, and you want to tally stats on a per-faction basis. It’s probably\nunnecessary to update your tallies with every new input record for every\nplayer in a given faction. Instead, you might be happy updating them after\nsome processing-time delay, say every second, or every minute. The nice side\neffect of using processing-time delays is that it has an equalizing effect across\nhigh-volume keys or windows: the resulting stream ends up being more\nuniform cardinality-wise.\nThere are two different approaches to processing-time delays in triggers:\naligned delays (where the delay slices up processing time into fixed regions\nthat align across keys and windows) and unaligned delays (where the delay is\nrelative to the data observed within a given window). A pipeline with\nunaligned delays might look like Example 2-4, the results of which are shown\nin Figure 2-7.\nExample 2-4. Triggering on aligned two-minute processing-time boundaries\nPCollection> totals = input\n.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES))\n.triggering(Repeatedly(AlignedDelay(TWO_MINUTES)))\n.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\nFigure 2-7. Two-minute aligned delay triggers (i.e., microbatching)\nThis sort of aligned delay trigger is effectively what you get from a\nmicrobatch streaming system like Spark Streaming. The nice thing about it is\npredictability; you get regular updates across all modified windows at the\nsame time. That’s also the downside: all updates happen at once, which\nresults in bursty workloads that often require greater peak provisioning to\nproperly handle the load. The alternative is to use an unaligned delay. That\nwould look something Example 2-5 in Beam. Figure 2-8 presents the results.\n00:00 / 00:00\nExample 2-5. Triggering on unaligned two-minute processing-time\nboundaries\nPCollection> totals = input\n.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES))\n.triggering(Repeatedly(UnalignedDelay(TWO_MINUTES))\n.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\nFigure 2-8. Two-minute unaligned delay triggers\nContrasting the unaligned delays in Figure 2-8 to the aligned delays in\nFigure 2-6, it’s easy to see how the unaligned delays spread the load out more\nevenly across time. The actual latencies involved for any given window differ\nbetween the two, sometimes more and sometimes less, but in the end the\naverage latency will remain essentially the same. From that perspective,\nunaligned delays are typically the better choice for large-scale processing\nbecause they result in a more even load distribution over time.\nRepeated update triggers are great for use cases in which we simply want\nperiodic updates to our results over time and are fine with those updates\nconverging toward correctness with no clear indication of when correctness is\nachieved. However, as we discussed in Chapter 1, the vagaries of distributed\nsystems often lead to a varying level of skew between the time an event\nhappens and the time it’s actually observed by your pipeline, which means it\ncan be difficult to reason about when your output presents an accurate and\ncomplete view of your input data. For cases in which input completeness\nmatters, it’s important to have some way of reasoning about completeness\nrather than blindly trusting the results calculated by whichever subset of data\nhappen to have found their way to your pipeline. Enter watermarks.\n00:00 / 00:00\nWhen : Watermarks\nWatermarks are a supporting aspect of the answer to the question: “ When in\nprocessing time are results materialized?” Watermarks are temporal notions\nof input completeness in the event-time domain. Worded differently, they are\nthe way the system measures progress and completeness relative to the event\ntimes of the records being processed in a stream of events (either bounded or\nunbounded, though their usefulness is more apparent in the unbounded case).\nRecall this diagram from Chapter 1, slightly modified in Figure 2-9, in which\nI described the skew between event time and processing time as an ever-\nchanging function of time for most real-world distributed data processing\nsystems.\nFigure 2-9. Event-time progress, skew, and watermarks\nThat meandering red line that I claimed represented reality is essentially the\nwatermark; it captures the progress of event-time completeness as processing\ntime progresses. Conceptually, you can think of the watermark as a function,\nF ( P ) → E , which takes a point in processing time and returns a point in event\ntime. That point in event time, E , is the point up to which the system\nbelieves all inputs with event times less than E have been observed. In other\nwords, it’s an assertion that no more data with event times less than E will\n4\never be seen again. Depending upon the type of watermark, perfect or\nheuristic, that assertion can be a strict guarantee or an educated guess,\nrespectively:\nPerfect watermarks\nFor the case in which we have perfect knowledge of all of the input data,\nit’s possible to construct a perfect watermark. In such a case, there is no\nsuch thing as late data; all data are early or on time.\nHeuristic watermarks\nFor many distributed input sources, perfect knowledge of the input data is\nimpractical, in which case the next best option is to provide a heuristic\nwatermark. Heuristic watermarks use whatever information is available\nabout the inputs (partitions, ordering within partitions if any, growth rates\nof files, etc.) to provide an estimate of progress that is as accurate as\npossible. In many cases, such watermarks can be remarkably accurate in\ntheir predictions. Even so, the use of a heuristic watermark means that it\nmight sometimes be wrong, which will lead to late data. We show you\nabout ways to deal with late data soon.\nBecause they provide a notion of completeness relative to our inputs,\nwatermarks form the foundation for the second type of trigger mentioned\npreviously: completeness triggers. Watermarks themselves are a fascinating\nand complex topic, as you’ll see when you get to Slava’s watermarks deep\ndive in Chapter 3. But for now, let’s look at them in action by updating our\nexample pipeline to utilize a completeness trigger built upon watermarks, as\ndemonstrated in Example 2-6.\nExample 2-6. Watermark completeness trigger\nPCollection> totals = input\n.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES))\n.triggering(AfterWatermark()))\n.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\nNow, an interesting quality of watermarks is that they are a class of functions,\nmeaning there are multiple different functions F ( P ) → E that satisfy the\nproperties of a watermark, to varying degrees of success. As I noted earlier,\nfor situations in which you have perfect knowledge of your input data, it\nmight be possible to build a perfect watermark, which is the ideal situation.\nBut for cases in which you lack perfect knowledge of the inputs or for which\nit’s simply too computationally expensive to calculate the perfect watermark,\nyou might instead choose to utilize a heuristic for defining your watermark.\nThe point I want to make here is that the given watermark algorithm in use is\nindependent from the pipeline itself. We’re not going to discuss in detail what\nit means to implement a watermark here (Slava does that in Chapter 3). For\nnow, to help drive home this idea that a given input set can have different\nwatermarks applied to it, let’s take a look at our pipeline in Example 2-6\nwhen executed on the same dataset but using two distinct watermark\nimplementations (Figure 2-10): on the left, a perfect watermark; on the right,\na heuristic watermark.\nIn both cases, windows are materialized as the watermark passes the end of\nthe window. The perfect watermark, as you might expect, perfectly captures\nthe event-time completeness of the pipeline as time progresses. In contrast,\nthe specific algorithm used for the heuristic watermark on the right fails to\ntake the value of 9 into account, which drastically changes the shape of the\nmaterialized outputs, both in terms of output latency and correctness (as seen\nby the incorrect answer of 5 that’s provided for the [12:00, 12:02) window).\nThe big difference between the watermark triggers from Figure 2-9 and the\nrepeated update triggers we saw in Figures 2-5 through 2-7 is that the\nwatermarks give us a way to reason about the completeness of our input.\nUntil the system materializes an output for a given window, we know that the\nsystem does not yet believe the inputs to be complete. This is especially\nimportant for use cases in which you want to reason about a lack of data in\nthe input, or missing data.\n5\n00:00 / 00:00\nFigure 2-10. Windowed summation on a streaming engine with perfect (left) and heuristic\n(right) watermarks\nA great example of a missing-data use case is outer joins. Without a notion of\ncompleteness like watermarks, how do you know when to give up and emit a\npartial join rather than continue to wait for that join to complete? You don’t.\nAnd basing that decision on a processing-time delay, which is the common\napproach in streaming systems that lack true watermark support, is not a safe\nway to go, because of the variable nature of event-time skew we spoke about\nin Chapter 1: as long as skew remains smaller than the chosen processing-\ntime delay, your missing-data results will be correct, but any time skew\ngrows beyond that delay, they will suddenly become in correct. From this\nperspective, event-time watermarks are a critical piece of the puzzle for many\nreal-world streaming use cases which must reason about a lack of data in the\ninput, such as outer joins, anomaly detection, and so on.\nNow, with that said, these watermark examples also highlight two\nshortcomings of watermarks (and any other notion of completeness),\nspecifically that they can be one of the following:\nToo slow\nWhen a watermark of any type is correctly delayed due to known\nunprocessed data (e.g., slowly growing input logs due to network\nbandwidth constraints), that translates directly into delays in output if\nadvancement of the watermark is the only thing you depend on for\nstimulating results.\nThis is most obvious in the left diagram of Figure 2-10, for which the late\narriving 9 holds back the watermark for all the subsequent windows, even\nthough the input data for those windows become complete earlier. This is\nparticularly apparent for the second window, [12:02, 12:04), for which it\ntakes nearly seven minutes from the time the first value in the window\noccurs until we see any results for the window whatsoever. The heuristic\nwatermark in this example doesn’t suffer the same issue quite so badly\n(five minutes until output), but don’t take that to mean heuristic\nwatermarks never suffer from watermark lag; that’s really just a\nconsequence of the record I chose to omit from the heuristic watermark in\nthis specific example.\nThe important point here is the following: Although watermarks provide\na very useful notion of completeness, depending upon completeness for\nproducing output is often not ideal from a latency perspective. Imagine a\ndashboard that contains valuable metrics, windowed by hour or day. It’s\nunlikely you’d want to wait a full hour or day to begin seeing results for\nthe current window; that’s one of the pain points of using classic batch\nsystems to power such systems. Instead, it would be much nicer to see the\nresults for those windows refine over time as the inputs evolve and\neventually become complete.\nToo fast\nWhen a heuristic watermark is incorrectly advanced earlier than it should\nbe, it’s possible for data with event times before the watermark to arrive\nsome time later, creating late data. This is what happened in the example\non the right: the watermark advanced past the end of the first window\nbefore all the input data for that window had been observed, resulting in\nan incorrect output value of 5 instead of 14. This shortcoming is strictly a\nproblem with heuristic watermarks; their heuristic nature implies they\nwill sometimes be wrong. As a result, relying on them alone for\ndetermining when to materialize output is insufficient if you care about\ncorrectness.\nIn Chapter 1, I made some rather emphatic statements about notions of\ncompleteness being insufficient for most use cases requiring robust out-of-\norder processing of unbounded data streams. These two shortcomings—\nwatermarks being too slow or too fast—are the foundations for those\narguments. You simply cannot get both low latency and correctness out of a\nsystem that relies solely on notions of completeness. So, for cases for which\nyou do want the best of both worlds, what’s a person to do? Well, if repeated\nupdate triggers provide low-latency updates but no way to reason about\ncompleteness, and watermarks provide a notion of completeness but variable\nand possible high latency, why not combine their powers together?\n6\nWhen : Early/On-Time/Late Triggers FTW!\nWe’ve now looked at the two main types of triggers: repeated update triggers\nand completeness/watermark triggers. In many case, neither of them alone is\nsufficient, but the combination of them together is. Beam recognizes this fact\nby providing an extension of the standard watermark trigger that also\nsupports repeated update triggering on either side of the watermark. This is\nknown as the early/on-time/late trigger because it partitions the panes that are\nmaterialized by the compound trigger into three categories:\nZero or more early panes , which are the result of a repeated update\ntrigger that periodically fires up until the watermark passes the end\nof the window. The panes generated by these firings contain\nspeculative results, but allow us to observe the evolution of the\nwindow over time as new input data arrive. This compensates for the\nshortcoming of watermarks sometimes being too slow.\nA single on-time pane , which is the result of the\ncompleteness/watermark trigger firing after the watermark passes the\nend of the window. This firing is special because it provides an\nassertion that the system now believes the input for this window to\nbe complete. This means that it is now safe to reason about missing\ndata ; for example, to emit a partial join when performing an outer\njoin.\nZero or more late panes , which are the result of another (possibly\ndifferent) repeated update trigger that periodically fires any time late\ndata arrive after the watermark has passed the end of the window. In\nthe case of a perfect watermark, there will always be zero late panes.\nBut in the case of a heuristic watermark, any data the watermark\nfailed to properly account for will result in a late firing. This\ncompensates for the shortcoming of watermarks being too fast.\nLet’s see how this looks in action. We’ll update our pipeline to use a periodic\nprocessing-time trigger with an aligned delay of one minute for the early\nfirings, and a per-record trigger for the late firings. That way, the early firings\n7\nwill give us some amount of batching for high-volume windows (thanks to\nthe fact that the trigger will fire only once per minute, regardless of the\nthroughput into the window), but we won’t introduce unnecessary latency for\nthe late firings, which are hopefully somewhat rare if we’re using a\nreasonably accurate heuristic watermark. In Beam, that looks Example 2-7\n(Figure 2-11 shows the results).\nExample 2-7. Early, on-time, and late firings via the early/on-time/late API\nPCollection> totals = input\n.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES))\n.triggering(AfterWatermark()\n.withEarlyFirings(AlignedDelay(ONE_MINUTE))\n.withLateFirings(AfterCount(1))))\n.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\nFigure 2-11. Windowed summation on a streaming engine with early, on-time, and late\nfirings\nThis version has two clear improvements over Figure 2-9:\nFor the “watermarks too slow” case in the second window, [12:02,\n12:04): we now provide periodic early updates once per minute. The\ndifference is most stark in the perfect watermark case, for which\ntime-to-first-output is reduced from almost seven minutes down to\nthree and a half; but it’s also clearly improved in the heuristic case,\nas well. Both versions now provide steady refinements over time\n(panes with values 7, 10, then 18), with relatively minimal latency\nbetween the input becoming complete and materialization of the\nfinal output pane for the window.\nFor the “heuristic watermarks too fast” case in the first window,\n00:00 / 00:00\n[12:00, 12:02): when the value of 9 shows up late, we immediately\nincorporate it into a new, corrected pane with value of 14.\nOne interesting side effect of these new triggers is that they effectively\nnormalize the output pattern between the perfect and heuristic watermark\nversions. Whereas the two versions in Figure 2-10 were starkly different, the\ntwo versions here look quite similar. They also look much more similar to the\nvarious repeated update version from Figures 2-6 through 2-8, with one\nimportant difference: thanks to the use of the watermark trigger, we can also\nreason about input completeness in the results we generate with the early/on-\ntime/late trigger. This allows us to better handle use cases that care about\nmissing data , like outer joins, anomaly detection, and so on.\nThe biggest remaining difference between the perfect and heuristic early/on-\ntime/late versions at this point is window lifetime bounds. In the perfect\nwatermark case, we know we’ll never see any more data for a window after\nthe watermark has passed the end of it, hence we can drop all of our state for\nthe window at that time. In the heuristic watermark case, we still need to hold\non to the state for a window for some amount of time to account for late data.\nBut as of yet, our system doesn’t have any good way of knowing just how\nlong state needs to be kept around for each window. That’s where allowed\nlateness comes in.\nWhen : Allowed Lateness (i.e., Garbage Collection)\nBefore moving on to our last question (“ How do refinements of results\nrelate?”), I’d like to touch on a practical necessity within long-lived, out-of-\norder stream processing systems: garbage collection. In the heuristic\nwatermarks example in Figure 2-11, the persistent state for each window\nlingers around for the entire lifetime of the example; this is necessary to\nallow us to appropriately deal with late data when/if they arrive. But while it\nwould be great to be able to keep around all of our persistent state until the\nend of time, in reality, when dealing with an unbounded data source, it’s\noften not practical to keep state (including metadata) for a given window\nindefinitely; we’ll eventually run out of disk space (or at the very least tire of\npaying for it, as the value for older data diminishes over time).\nAs a result, any real-world out-of-order processing system needs to provide\nsome way to bound the lifetimes of the windows it’s processing. A clean and\nconcise way of doing this is by defining a horizon on the allowed lateness\nwithin the system; that is, placing a bound on how late any given record may\nbe (relative to the watermark) for the system to bother processing it; any data\nthat arrives after this horizon are simply dropped. After you’ve bounded how\nlate individual data may be, you’ve also established precisely how long the\nstate for windows must be kept around: until the watermark exceeds the\nlateness horizon for the end of the window. But in addition, you’ve also given\nthe system the liberty to immediately drop any data later than the horizon as\nsoon as they’re observed, which means the system doesn’t waste resources\nprocessing data that no one cares about.\nMEASURING LATENESS\nIt might seem a little odd to be specifying a horizon for handling late data\nusing the very metric that resulted in the late data in the first place (i.e.,\nthe heuristic watermark). And in some sense it is. But of the options\navailable, it’s arguably the best. The only other practical option would be\nto specify the horizon in processing time (e.g., keep windows around for\n10 minutes of processing time after the watermark passes the end of the\nwindow), but using processing time would leave the garbage collection\npolicy vulnerable to issues within the pipeline itself (e.g., workers\ncrashing, causing the pipeline to stall for a few minutes), which could\nlead to windows that didn’t actually have a chance to handle late data that\nthey otherwise should have. By specifying the horizon in the event-time\ndomain, garbage collection is directly tied to the actual progress of the\npipeline, which decreases the likelihood that a window will miss its\nopportunity to handle late data appropriately.\nNote however, that not all watermarks are created equal. When we speak\nof watermarks in this book, we generally refer to low watermarks, which\npessimistically attempt to capture the event time of the oldest\nunprocessed record the system is aware of. The nice thing about dealing\nwith lateness via low watermarks is that they are resilient to changes in\nevent-time skew; no matter how large the skew in a pipeline may grow,\nthe low watermark will always track the oldest outstanding event known\nto the system, providing the best guarantee of correctness possible.\nIn contrast, some systems may use the term “watermark” to mean other\nthings. For example, watermarks in Spark Structured Streaming are high\nwatermarks, which optimistically track the event time of the newest\nrecord the system is aware of. When dealing with lateness, the system is\nfree to garbage collect any window older than the high watermark\nadjusted by some user-specified lateness threshold. In other words, the\nsystem allows you to specify the maximum amount of event-time skew\nyou expect to see in your pipeline, and then throws away any data outside\nof that skew window. This can work well if skew within your pipeline\nremains within some constant delta, but is more prone to incorrectly\ndiscarding data than low watermarking schemes.\nBecause the interaction between allowed lateness and the watermark is a little\nsubtle, it’s worth looking at an example. Let’s take the heuristic watermark\npipeline from Example 2-7/Figure 2-11 and add in Example 2-8 a lateness\nhorizon of one minute (note that this particular horizon has been chosen\nstrictly because it fits nicely into the diagram; for real-world use cases, a\nlarger horizon would likely be much more practical):\nExample 2-8. Early/on-time/late firings with allowed lateness\nPCollection> totals = input\n.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES))\n.triggering(\nAfterWatermark()\n.withEarlyFirings(AlignedDelay(ONE_MINUTE))\n.withLateFirings(AfterCount(1)))\n.withAllowedLateness(ONE_MINUTE))\n.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\nThe execution of this pipeline would look something like Figure 2-12, in\nwhich I’ve added the following features to highlight the effects of allowed\nlateness:\nThe thick black line denoting the current position in processing time\nis now annotated with ticks indicating the lateness horizon (in event\ntime) for all active windows.\nWhen the watermark passes the lateness horizon for a window, that\nwindow is closed, which means that all state for the window is\ndiscarded. I leave around a dotted rectangle showing the extent of\ntime (in both domains) that the window covered when it was closed,\nwith a little tail extending to the right to denote the lateness horizon\nfor the window (for contrasting against the watermark).\nFor this diagram only, I’ve added an additional late datum for the\nfirst window with value 6. The 6 is late, but still within the allowed\nlateness horizon and thus is incorporated into an updated result with\nvalue 11. The 9, however, arrives beyond the lateness horizon, so it\nis simply dropped.\nFigure 2-12. Allowed lateness with early/on-time/late firings\nTwo final side notes about lateness horizons:\nTo be absolutely clear, if you happen to be consuming data from\nsources for which perfect watermarks are available, there’s no need\nto deal with late data, and an allowed lateness horizon of zero\nseconds will be optimal. This is what we saw in the perfect\nwatermark portion of Figure 2-10.\nOne noteworthy exception to the rule of needing to specify lateness\nhorizons, even when heuristic watermarks are in use, would be\nsomething like computing global aggregates over all time for a\ntractably finite number of keys (e.g., computing the total number of\n00:00 / 00:00\nvisits to your site over all time, grouped by web browser family). In\nthis case, the number of active windows in the system is bounded by\nthe limited keyspace in use. As long as the number of keys remains\nmanageably low, there’s no need to worry about limiting the lifetime\nof windows via allowed lateness.\nPracticality sated, let’s move on to our fourth and final question.\nHow : Accumulation\nWhen triggers are used to produce multiple panes for a single window over\ntime, we find ourselves confronted with the last question: “ How do\nrefinements of results relate?” In the examples we’ve seen so far, each\nsuccessive pane is built upon the one immediately preceding it. However,\nthere are actually three different modes of accumulation:\nDiscarding\nEvery time a pane is materialized, any stored state is discarded. This\nmeans that each successive pane is independent from any that came\nbefore. Discarding mode is useful when the downstream consumer is\nperforming some sort of accumulation itself; for example, when sending\nintegers into a system that expects to receive deltas that it will sum\ntogether to produce a final count.\nAccumulating\nAs in Figures 2-6 through 2-11, every time a pane is materialized, any\nstored state is retained, and future inputs are accumulated into the existing\nstate. This means that each successive pane builds upon the previous\npanes. Accumulating mode is useful when later results can simply\noverwrite previous results, such as when storing output in a key/value\nstore like HBase or Bigtable.\nAccumulating and retracting\nThis is like accumulating mode, but when producing a new pane, it also\nproduces independent retractions for the previous pane(s). Retractions\n8 9\n(combined with the new accumulated result) are essentially an explicit\nway of saying “I previously told you the result was X , but I was wrong.\nGet rid of the X I told you last time, and replace it with Y .” There are two\ncases for which retractions are particularly helpful:\nWhen consumers downstream are regrouping data by a different\ndimension , it’s entirely possible the new value may end up keyed\ndifferently from the previous value and thus end up in a different\ngroup. In that case, the new value can’t just overwrite the old value;\nyou instead need the retraction to remove the old value\nWhen dynamic windows (e.g., sessions, which we look at more\nclosely in a few moments) are in use, the new value might be\nreplacing more than one previous window, due to window merging.\nIn this case, it can be difficult to determine from the new window\nalone which old windows are being replaced. Having explicit\nretractions for the old windows makes the task straightforward. We\nsee an example of this in detail in Chapter 8.\nThe different semantics for each group are somewhat clearer when seen side-\nby-side. Consider the two panes for the second window (the one with event-\ntime range [12:06, 12:08)) in Figure 2-11 (the one with early/on-time/late\ntriggers). Table 2-1 shows what the values for each pane would look like\nacross the three accumulation modes (with accumulating mode being the\nspecific mode used in Figure 2-11 itself).\nTable 2-1. Comparing accumulation modes using the second window\nfrom Figure 2-11\n(^) Discarding Accumulating Accumulating &\nRetracting\nPane 1: inputs=[3] 3 3 3\nPane 2: inputs=[8, 1] 9 12 12, –3\nValue of final normal\npane 9 12 12\nSum of all panes 12 15 12\nLet’s take a closer look at what’s happening:\nDiscarding\nEach pane incorporates only the values that arrived during that specific\npane. As such, the final value observed does not fully capture the total\nsum. However, if you were to sum all of the independent panes\nthemselves, you would arrive at a correct answer of 12. This is why\ndiscarding mode is useful when the downstream consumer itself is\nperforming some sort of aggregation on the materialized panes.\nAccumulating\nAs in Figure 2-11, each pane incorporates the values that arrived during\nthat specific pane, plus all of the values from previous panes. As such, the\nfinal value observed correctly captures the total sum of 12. If you were to\nsum up the individual panes themselves, however, you’d effectively be\ndouble-counting the inputs from pane 1, giving you an incorrect total sum\nof 15. This is why accumulating mode is most useful when you can\nsimply overwrite previous values with new values: the new value already\nincorporates all of the data seen thus far.\nAccumulating and retracting\nEach pane includes both a new accumulating mode value as well as a\nretraction of the previous pane’s value. As such, both the last value\nobserved (excluding retractions) as well as the total sum of all\nmaterialized panes (including retractions) provide you with the correct\nanswer of 12. This is why retractions are so powerful.\nExample 2-9 demonstrates discarding mode in action, illustrating the changes\nwe would make to Example 2-7:\nExample 2-9. Discarding mode version of early/on-time/late firings\nPCollection> totals = input\n.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES))\n.triggering(\nAfterWatermark()\n.withEarlyFirings(AlignedDelay(ONE_MINUTE))\n.withLateFirings(AtCount(1)))\n.discardingFiredPanes())\n.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\nRunning again on a streaming engine with a heuristic watermark would\nproduce output like that shown in Figure 2-13.\nFigure 2-13. Discarding mode version of early/on-time/late firings on a streaming engine\nEven though the overall shape of the output is similar to the accumulating\nmode version from Figure 2-11, note how none of the panes in this discarding\nversion overlap. As a result, each output is independent from the others.\nIf we want to look at retractions in action, the change would be similar, as\nshown in Example 2-10. ??? depicts the results.\nExample 2-10. Accumulating and retracting mode version of early/on-\ntime/late firings\nPCollection> totals = input\n.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES))\n.triggering(\nAfterWatermark()\n.withEarlyFirings(AlignedDelay(ONE_MINUTE))\n.withLateFirings(AtCount(1)))\n.accumulatingAndRetractingFiredPanes())\n.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n00:00 / 00:00\nAccumulating and retracting mode version of early/late firings on a streaming\nengine\nBecause the panes for each window all overlap, it’s a little tricky to see the\nretractions clearly. The retractions are indicated in red, which combines with\nthe overlapping blue panes to yield a slightly purplish color. I’ve also\nhorizontally shifted the values of the two outputs within a given pane slightly\n(and separated them with a comma) to make them easier to differentiate.\nFigure 2-14 combines the final frames of Figures 2-9, 2-11 (heuristic only),\nand side-by-side, providing a nice visual contrast of the three modes.\nFigure 2-14. Side-by-side comparison of accumulation modes\nAs you can imagine, the modes in the order presented (discarding,\naccumulating, accumulating and retracting) are each successively more\nexpensive in terms of storage and computation costs. To that end, choice of\naccumulation mode provides yet another dimension for making trade-offs\nalong the axes of correctness, latency, and cost.\nSummary\nWith this chapter complete, you now understand the basics of robust stream\nprocessing and are ready to go forth into the world and do amazing things. Of\n00:00 / 00:00\ncourse, there are eight more chapters anxiously waiting for your attention, so\nhopefully you won’t go forth like right now, this very minute. But regardless,\nlet’s recap what we’ve just covered, lest you forget any of it in your haste to\namble forward. First, the major concepts we touched upon:\nEvent time versus processing time\nThe all-important distinction between when events occurred and when\nthey are observed by your data processing system.\nWindowing\nThe commonly utilized approach to managing unbounded data by slicing\nit along temporal boundaries (in either processing time or event time,\nthough we narrow the definition of windowing in the Beam Model to\nmean only within event time).\nTriggers\nThe declarative mechanism for specifying precisely when materialization\nof output makes sense for your particular use case.\nWatermarks\nThe powerful notion of progress in event time that provides a means of\nreasoning about completeness (and thus missing data) in an out-of-order\nprocessing system operating on unbounded data.\nAccumulation\nThe relationship between refinements of results for a single window for\ncases in which it’s materialized multiple times as it evolves.\nSecond, the four questions we used to frame our exploration:\nWhat results are calculated? = transformations.\nWhere in event time are results calculated? = windowing.\nWhen in processing time are results materialized? = triggers plus\nwatermarks.\nHow do refinements of results relate? = accumulation.\nThird, to drive home the flexibility afforded by this model of stream\nprocessing (because in the end, that’s really what this is all about: balancing\ncompeting tensions like correctness, latency, and cost), a recap of the major\nvariations in output we were able to achieve over the same dataset with only a\nminimal amount of code change:\nInteger summation\nExample 2-1 / Figure 2-3\nInteger summation\nFixed windows batch\nExample 2-2 / Figure 2-5\nInteger summation\nFixed windows streaming\nRepeated per-record\ntrigger\nExample 2-3 / Figure 2-6\nInteger summation\nFixed windows streaming\nRepeated aligned-delay\ntrigger\nExample 2-4 / Figure 2-7\nInteger summation\nFixed windows streaming\nRepeated unaligned-delay\ntrigger\nExample 2-5 / Figure 2-8\nInteger summation\nFixed windows streaming\nHeuristic watermark\ntrigger\nExample 2-6 / Figure 2-10\nInteger summation\nFixed windows streaming\nEarly/on-time/late trigger\nInteger summation\nFixed windows streaming\nEarly/on-time/late trigger\nInteger summation\nFixed windows streaming\nEarly/on-time/late trigger\nDiscarding\nExample 2-9 / Figure 2-13\nAccumulating\nExample 2-7 / Figure 2-11\nAccumulating and\nRetracting\nExample 2-10 / ???\nAll that said, at this point, we’ve really looked at only one type of\nwindowing: fixed windowing in event time. As we know, there are a number\nof dimensions to windowing, and I’d like to touch upon at least two more of\nthose before we call it day with the Beam Model. First, however, we’re going\nto take a slight detour to dive deeper into the world of watermarks, as this\nknowledge will help frame future discussions (and be fascinating in and of\nitself). Enter Slava, stage right...\nIf you’re fortunate enough to be reading the Safari version of the book, you\nhave full-blown time-lapse animations just like in “Streaming 102”. For print,\nKindle, and other ebook versions, there are static images with a link to\nanimated versions on the web.\nBear with me here. Fine-grained emotional expressions via composite\npunctuation (i.e., emoticons) are strictly forbidden in O’Reilly publications .\nAnd indeed, we did just that with the original triggers feature in Beam. In\nretrospect, we went a bit overboard. Future iterations will be simpler and\neasier to use, and in this book I focus only on the pieces that are likely to\nremain in some form or another.\nMore accurately, the input to the function is really the state at time P of\neverything upstream of the point in the pipeline where the watermark is being\nobserved: the input source, buffered data, data actively being processed, and\nso on; but conceptually it’s simpler to think of it as a mapping from\nprocessing time to event time.\nNote that I specifically chose to omit the value of 9 from the heuristic\nwatermark because it will help me to make some important points about late\ndata and watermark lag. In reality, a heuristic watermark might be just as\nlikely to omit some other value(s) instead, which in turn could have\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nsignificantly less drastic effect on the watermark. If winnowing late-arriving\ndata from the watermark is your goal (which is very valid in some cases, such\nas abuse detection, for which you just want to see a significant majority of the\ndata as quickly as possible), you don’t necessarily want a heuristic watermark\nrather than a perfect watermark. What you really want is a percentile\nwatermark, which explicitly drops some percentile of late-arriving data from\nits calculations. See Chapter 3.\nWhich isn’t to say there aren’t use cases that care primarily about\ncorrectness and not so much about latency; in those cases, using an accurate\nwatermark as the sole driver of output from a pipeline is a reasonable\napproach.\nAnd, as we know from before, this assertion is either guaranteed, in the case\nof a perfect watermark being used, or an educated guess, in the case of a\nheuristic watermark.\nYou might note that there should logically be a fourth mode: discarding and\nretracting. That mode isn’t terribly useful in most cases, so I don’t discuss it\nfurther here.\nIn retrospect, it probably would have been clearer to choose a different set\nof names that are more oriented toward the observed nature of data in the\nmaterialized stream (e.g., “output modes”) rather than names describing the\nstate management semantics that yield those data. Perhaps: discarding mode\n→ delta mode, accumulating mode → value mode, accumulating and\nretracting mode → value and retraction mode? However, the\ndiscarding/accumulating/accumulating and retracting names are enshrined in\nthe 1.x and 2.x lineages of the Beam Model, so I don’t want to introduce\npotential confusion in the book by deviating. Also, it’s very likely\naccumulating modes will blend into the background more with Beam 3.0 and\nthe introduction of sink triggers; more on this when we discuss SQL in\nChapter 8.\n6\n7\n8\n9\nChapter 3. Watermarks\nSo far, we have been looking at stream processing from the perspective of the\npipeline author or data scientist. Chapter 2 introduced watermarks as part of\nthe answer to the fundamental questions of where in event-time processing is\ntaking place and when in processing time results are materialized. In this\nchapter, we approach the same questions, but instead from the perspective of\nthe underlying mechanics of the stream processing system. Looking at these\nmechanics will help us motivate, understand, and apply the concepts around\nwatermarks. We discuss how watermarks are created at the point of data\ningress, how they propagate through a data processing pipeline, and how they\naffect output timestamps. We also demonstrate how watermarks preserve the\nguarantees that are necessary for answering the questions of where in event-\ntime data are processed and when it is materialized, while dealing with\nunbounded data.\nDefinition\nConsider any pipeline that ingests data and outputs results continuously. We\nwish to solve the general problem of when it is safe to call an event-time\nwindow closed, meaning that the window does not expect any more data. To\ndo so we would like to characterize the progress that the pipeline is making\nrelative to its unbounded input.\nOne naive approach for solving the event-time windowing problem would be\nto simply base our event-time windows on the current processing time. As we\nsaw in Chapter 1, we quickly run into trouble—data processing and transport\nis not instantaneous, so processing and event times are almost never equal.\nAny hiccup or spike in our pipeline might cause us to incorrectly assign\nmessages to windows. Ultimately, this strategy fails because we have no\nrobust way to make any guarantees about such windows.\nAnother intuitive, but ultimately incorrect, approach would be to consider the\nrate of messages processed by the pipeline. Although this is an interesting\nmetric, the rate may vary arbitrarily with changes in input, variability of\nexpected results, resources available for processing, and so on. Even more\nimportant, rate does not help answer the fundamental questions of\ncompleteness. Specifically, rate does not tell us when we have seen all of the\nmessages for a particular time interval. In a real-world system, there will be\nsituations in which messages are not making progress through the system.\nThis could be the result of transient errors (such as crashes, network failures,\nmachine downtime), or the result of persistent errors such as application-level\nfailures that require changes to the application logic or other manual\nintervention to resolve. Of course, if lots of failures are occurring, a rate-of-\nprocessing metric might be a good proxy for detecting this. However a rate\nmetric could never tell us that a single message is failing to make progress\nthrough our pipeline. Even a single such message, however, can arbitrarily\naffect the correctness of the output results.\nWe require a more robust measure of progress. To arrive there, we make one\nfundamental assumption about our streaming data: each message has an\nassociated logical event timestamp. This assumption is reasonable in the\ncontext of continuously arriving unbounded data because this implies the\ncontinuous generation of input data. In most cases, we can take the time of\nthe original event’s occurrence as its logical event timestamp. With all input\nmessages containing an event timestamp, we can then examine the\ndistribution of such timestamps in any pipeline. Such a pipeline might be\ndistributed to process in parallel over many agents and consuming input\nmessages with no guarantee of ordering between individual shards. Thus, the\nset of event timestamps for active in-flight messages in this pipeline will form\na distribution, as illustrated in Figure 3-1.\nMessages are ingested by the pipeline, processed, and eventually marked\ncompleted. Each message is either “in-flight,” meaning that it has been\nreceived but not yet completed, or “completed,” meaning that no more\nprocessing on behalf of this message is required. If we examine the\ndistribution of messages by event time, it will look something like Figure 3-1.\nAs time advances, more messages will be added to the “in-flight” distribution\non the right, and more of those messages from the “in-flight” part of the\ndistribution will be completed and moved into the “completed” distribution.\nFigure 3-1. Distribution of in-flight and completed message event times within a streaming\npipeline. New messages arrive as input and remain “in-flight” until processing for them\ncompletes. The leftmost edge of the “in-flight” distribution corresponds to the oldest\nunprocessed element at any given moment.\nThere is a key point on this distribution, located at the leftmost edge of the\n“in-flight” distribution, corresponding to the oldest event timestamp of any\nunprocessed message of our pipeline. We use this value to define the\nwatermark:\n00:00 / 00:00\n1\nThe watermark is a monotonically increasing timestamp of the oldest\nwork not yet completed.\nThere are two fundamental properties that are provided by this definition that\nmake it useful:\nCompleteness\nIf the watermark has advanced past some timestamp T , we are guaranteed\nby its monotonic property that no more processing will occur for on-time\n(nonlate data) events at or before T. Therefore, we can correctly emit any\naggregations at or before T. In other words, the watermark allows us to\nknow when it is correct to close a window.\nVisibility\nIf a message is stuck in our pipeline for any reason, the watermark cannot\nadvance. Furthermore, we will be able to find the source of the problem\nby examining the message that is preventing the watermark from\nadvancing.\nSource Watermark Creation\nWhere do these watermarks come from? To establish a watermark for a data\nsource, we must assign a logical event timestamp to every message entering\nthe pipeline from that source. As Chapter 2 informs us, all watermark\ncreation falls into one of two broad categories: perfect or heuristic. To remind\nourselves about the difference between perfect and heuristic watermarks, let’s\nlook at Figure 3-2, which presents the windowed summation example from\nChapter 2.\n1\nFigure 3-2. Windowed summation with perfect (left) and heuristic (right) watermarks\n00:00 / 00:00\nNotice that the distinguishing feature is that perfect watermarks ensure that\nthe watermark accounts for all data, whereas heuristic watermarks admit\nsome late-data elements.\nAfter the watermark is created as either perfect or heuristic, watermarks\nremain so throughout the rest of the pipeline. As to what makes watermark\ncreation perfect or heuristic, it depends a great deal on the nature of the\nsource that’s being consumed. To see why, let’s look at a few examples of\neach type of watermark creation.\nPerfect Watermark Creation\nPerfect watermark creation assigns timestamps to incoming messages in such\na way that the resulting watermark is a strict guarantee that no data with\nevent times less than the watermark will ever be seen again from this source.\nPipelines using perfect watermark creation never have to deal with late data;\nthat is, data that arrive after the watermark has advanced past the event times\nof newly arriving messages. However, perfect watermark creation requires\nperfect knowledge of the input, and thus is impractical for many real-world\ndistributed input sources. Here are a couple of examples of use cases that can\ncreate perfect watermarks:\nIngress timestamping\nA source that assigns ingress times as the event times for data entering the\nsystem can create a perfect watermark. In this case, the source watermark\nsimply tracks the current processing time as observed by the pipeline.\nThis is essentially the method that nearly all streaming systems\nsupporting windowing prior to 2016 used.\nBecause event times are assigned from a single, monotonically increasing\nsource (actual processing time), the system thus has perfect knowledge\nabout which timestamps will come next in the stream of data. As a result,\nevent-time progress and windowing semantics become vastly easier to\nreason about. The downside, of course, is that the watermark has no\ncorrelation to the event times of the data themselves; those event times\nwere effectively discarded, and the watermark instead merely tracks the\nprogress of data relative to its arrival in the system.\nStatic sets of time-ordered logs\nA statically sized input source of time-ordered logs (e.g., an Apache\nKafka topic with a static set of partitions, where each partition of the\nsource contains monotonically increasing event times) would be\nrelatively straightforward source atop which to create a perfect\nwatermark. To do so, the source would simply track the minimum event\ntime of unprocessed data across the known and static set of source\npartitions (i.e., the minimum of the event times of the most recently read\nrecord in each of the partitions).\nSimilar to the aforementioned ingress timestamps, the system has perfect\nknowledge about which timestamps will come next, thanks to the fact that\nevent times across the static set of partitions are known to increase\nmonotonically. This is effectively a form of bounded out-of-order\nprocessing; the amount of disorder across the known set of partitions is\nbounded by the minimum observed event time among those partitions.\nTypically, the only way you can guarantee monotonically increasing\ntimestamps within partitions is if the timestamps within those partitions\nare assigned as data are written to it; for example, by web frontends\nlogging events directly into Kafka. Though still a limited use case, this is\ndefinitely a much more useful one than ingress timestamping upon arrival\nat the data processing system because the watermark tracks meaningful\nevent times of the underlying data.\nHeuristic Watermark Creation\nHeuristic watermark creation, on the other hand, creates a watermark that is\nmerely an estimate that no data with event times less than the watermark will\never be seen again. Pipelines using heuristic watermark creation might need\nto deal with some amount of late data. Late data is any data that arrives after\nthe watermark has advanced past the event time of this data. Late data is only\npossible with heuristic watermark creation. If the heuristic is a reasonably\n2\ngood one, the amount of late data might be very small, and the watermark\nremains useful as a completion estimate. The system still needs to provide a\nway for the user to cope with late data if it’s to support use cases requiring\ncorrectness (e.g., things like billing).\nFor many real-world, distributed input sources, it’s computationally or\noperationally impractical to construct a perfect watermark, but still possible\nto build a highly accurate heuristic watermark by taking advantage of\nstructural features of the input data source. Following are two example for\nwhich heuristic watermarks (of varying quality) are possible:\nDynamic sets of time-ordered logs\nConsider a dynamic set of structured log files (each individual file\ncontaining records with monotonically increasing event times relative to\nother records in the same file but with no fixed relationship of event times\nbetween files), where the full set of expected log files (i.e., partitions, in\nKafka parlance) is not known at runtime. Such inputs are often found in\nglobal-scale services constructed and managed by a number of\nindependent teams. In such a use case, creating a perfect watermark over\nthe input is intractable, but creating an accurate heuristic watermark is\nquite possible.\nBy tracking the minimum event times of unprocessed data in the existing\nset of log files, monitoring growth rates, and utilizing external\ninformation like network topology and bandwidth availability, you can\ncreate a remarkably accurate watermark, even given the lack of perfect\nknowledge of all the inputs. This type of input source is one of the most\ncommon types of unbounded datasets found at Google, so we have\nextensive experience with creating and analyzing watermark quality for\nsuch scenarios and have seen them used to good effect across a number of\nuse cases.\nGoogle Cloud Pub/Sub\nCloud Pub/Sub is an interesting use case. Pub/Sub currently makes no\nguarantees on in-order delivery; even if a single publisher publishes two\nmessages in order, there’s a chance (usually small) that they might be\ndelivered out of order (this is due to the dynamic nature of the underlying\narchitecture, which allows for transparent scaling up to very high levels\nof throughput with zero user intervention). As a result, there’s no way to\nguarantee a perfect watermark for Cloud Pub/Sub. The Cloud Dataflow\nteam has, however, built a reasonably accurate heuristic watermark by\ntaking advantage of what knowledge is available about the data in Cloud\nPub/Sub. The implementation of this heuristic is discussed at length as a\ncase study later in this chapter.\nConsider an example where users play a mobile game, and their scores are\nsent to our pipeline for processing: you can generally assume that for any\nsource utilizing mobile devices for input it will be generally impossible to\nprovide a perfect watermark. Due to the problem of devices that go offline for\nextended periods of time, there’s just no way to provide any sort of\nreasonable estimate of absolute completeness for such a data source. You\ncan, however, imagine building a watermark that accurately tracks input\ncompleteness for devices that are currently online, similar to the Google\nPub/Sub watermark described a moment ago. Users who are actively online\nare likely the most relevant subset of users from the perspective of providing\nlow-latency results anyway, so this often isn’t as much of a shortcoming as\nyou might initially think.\nWith heuristic watermark creation, broadly speaking, the more that is known\nabout the source, the better the heuristic, and the fewer late data items will be\nseen. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, given that the types of sources,\ndistributions of events, and usage patterns will vary greatly. But in either case\n(perfect or heuristic), after a watermark is created at the input source, the\nsystem can propagate the watermark through the pipeline perfectly. This\nmeans perfect watermarks will remain perfect downstream, and heuristic\nwatermarks will remain strictly as heuristic as they were when established.\nThis is the benefit of the watermark approach: you can reduce the complexity\nof tracking completeness in a pipeline entirely to the problem of creating a\nwatermark at the source.\nWatermark Propagation\nSo far, we have considered only the watermark for the inputs within the\ncontext of a single operation or stage. However, most real-world pipelines\nconsist of multiple stages. Understanding how watermarks propagate across\nindependent stages is important in understanding how they affect the pipeline\nas a whole and the observed latency of its results.\nPIPELINE STAGES\nDifferent stages are typically necessary every time your pipeline groups\ndata together by some new dimension. For example, if you had a pipeline\nthat consumed raw data, computed some per-user aggregates, and then\nused those per-user aggregates to compute some per-team aggregates,\nyou’d likely end up with a three-stage pipeline:\nOne consuming the raw, ungrouped data\nOne grouping the data by user and computing per-user\naggregates\nOne grouping the data by team and computing per-team\naggregates\nWe learn more about the effects of grouping on pipeline shapes in\nChapter 6.\nWatermarks are created at input sources, as discussed in the preceding\nsection. They then conceptually flow through the system as data progress\nthrough it. You can track watermarks at varying levels of granularity. For\npipelines comprising multiple distinct stages, each stage likely tracks its own\nwatermark, whose value is a function of all the inputs and stages that come\nbefore it. Therefore, stages that come later in the pipeline will have\nwatermarks that are further in the past (because they’ve seen less of the\noverall input).\nWe can define watermarks at the boundaries of any single operation, or stage,\n3\nin the pipeline. This is useful not only in understanding the relative progress\nthat each stage in the pipeline is making, but for dispatching timely results\nindependently and as soon as possible for each individual stage. We give the\nfollowing definitions for the watermarks at the boundaries of stages:\nAn input watermark , which captures the progress of everything\nupstream of that stage (i.e., how complete the input is for that stage).\nFor sources, the input watermark is a source-specific function\ncreating the watermark for the input data. For nonsource stages, the\ninput watermark is defined as the minimum of the output\nwatermarks of all shards/partitions/instances of all of its upstream\nsources and stages.\nAn output watermark , which captures the progress of the stage itself,\nand is essentially defined as the minimum of the stage’s input\nwatermark and the event times of all nonlate data active messages\nwithin the stage. Exactly what “active” encompasses is somewhat\ndependent upon the operations a given stage actually performs, and\nthe implementation of the stream processing system. It typically\nincludes data buffered for aggregation but not yet materialized\ndownstream, pending output data in flight to downstream stages, and\nso on.\nOne nice feature of defining an input and output watermark for a specific\nstage is that we can use these to calculate the amount of event-time latency\nintroduced by a stage. Subtracting the value of a stage’s output watermark\nfrom the value of its input watermark gives the amount of event-time latency\nor lag introduced by the stage. This lag is the notion of how far delayed\nbehind real time the output of each stage will be. As an example, a stage\nperforming 10-second windowed aggregations will have a lag of 10 seconds\nor more, meaning that the output of the stage will be at least that much\ndelayed behind the input and real time. Definitions of input and output\nwatermarks provide a recursive relationship of watermarks throughout a\npipeline. Each subsequent stage in a pipeline delays the watermark as\nnecessary, based on event-time lag of the stage.\nProcessing within each stage is also not monolithic. We can segment the\nprocessing within one stage into a flow with several conceptual components,\neach of which contributes to the output watermark. As mentioned previously,\nthe exact nature of these components depends on the operations the stage\nperforms and the implementation of the system. Conceptually, each such\ncomponent serves as a buffer where active messages can reside until some\noperation has completed. For example, as data arrives, it is buffered for\nprocessing. Processing might then write the data to state for later delayed\naggregation. Delayed aggregation, when triggered, might write the results to\nan output buffer awaiting consumption from a downstream stage, as shown in\nFigure 3-3.\nFigure 3-3. Example system components of a streaming system stage, containing buffers of\nin-flight data. Each will have associated watermark tracking, and the overall output\nwatermark of the stage will be the minimum of the watermarks across all such buffers.\nWe can track each such buffer with its own watermark. The minimum of the\nwatermarks across the buffers of each stage forms the output watermark of\nthe stage. Thus the output watermark could be the minimum of the following:\nPer-source watermark—for each sending stage.\nPer-external input watermark—for sources external to the pipeline\nPer-state component watermark—for each type of state that can be\nwritten\nPer-output buffer watermark—for each receiving stage\nMaking watermarks available at this level of granularity also provides better\nvisibility into the behavior of the system. The watermarks track locations of\nmessages across various buffers in the system, allowing for easier diagnosis\nof stuckness.\nUnderstanding Watermark Propagation\nTo get a better sense for the relationship between input and output\nwatermarks and how they affect watermark propagation, let’s look at an\nexample. Let’s consider gaming scores, but instead of computing sums of\nteam scores, we’re going to take a stab at measuring user engagement levels.\nWe’ll do this by first calculating per-user session lengths, under the\nassumption that the amount of time a user stays engaged with the game is a\nreasonable proxy for how much they’re enjoying it. After answering our four\nquestions once to calculate sessions lengths, we’ll then answer them a second\ntime to calculate average session lengths within fixed periods of time.\nTo make our example even more interesting, lets say that we are working\nwith two datasets, one for Mobile Scores and one for Console Scores. We\nwould like to perform identical score calculations via integer summation in\nparallel over these two independant datasets. One pipeline is calculating\nscores for users playing on mobile devices, whereas the other is for users\nplaying on home gaming consoles, perhaps due to different data collection\nstrategies employed for the different platforms. The important point is that\nthese two stages are performing the same operation but over different data,\nand thus with very different output watermarks.\nTo begin, let’s take a look at Example 3-1 to see what the abbreviated code\nfor what the first section of this pipeline might be like.\nExample 3-1. Calculating session lengths\nPCollection mobileSessions = IO.read(new MobileInputSource())\n.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n.triggering(AtWatermark())\n.discardingFiredPanes())\n.apply(CalculateWindowLength());\nPCollection consoleSessions = IO.read(new ConsoleInputSource())\n.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n.triggering(AtWatermark())\n.discardingFiredPanes())\n.apply(CalculateWindowLength());\nHere, we read in each of our inputs independently, and whereas previously\nwe were keying our collections by team, in this example we key by user.\nAfter that, for the first stage of each pipeline, we window into sessions and\nthen call a custom PTransform named CalculateWindowLength. This\nPTransform simply groups by key (i.e., User) and then computes the per-\nuser session length by treating the size of the current window as the value for\nthat window. In this case, we’re fine with the default trigger (AtWatermark)\nand accumulation mode (discardingFiredPanes) settings, but I’ve listed\nthem explicitly for completeness. The output for each pipeline for two\nparticular users might look something like Figure 3-4.\nFigure 3-4. Per-user session lengths across two different input pipelines\nBecause we need to track data across multiple stages, we track everything\nrelated to Mobile Scores in red, everything related to Console Scores in blue,\nwhile the watermark and output for Average Session Lengths in Figure 3-5\nare yellow.\nWe have answered the four questions of what , where , when , and how to\ncompute individual session lengths. Next we’ll answer them a second time to\ntransform those session lengths into global session-length averages within\n00:00 / 00:00\nfixed windows of time. This requires us to first flatten our two data sources\ninto one, and then re-window into fixed windows; we’ve already captured the\nimportant essence of the session in the session-length value we computed,\nand we now want to compute a global average of those sessions within\nconsistent windows of time over the course of the day. Example 3-2 shows\nthe code for this.\nExample 3-2. Calculating session lengths\nPCollection mobileSessions = IO.read(new MobileInputSource())\n.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n.triggering(AtWatermark())\n.discardingFiredPanes())\n.apply(CalculateWindowLength());\nPCollection consoleSessions = IO.read(new ConsoleInputSource())\n.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n.triggering(AtWatermark())\n.discardingFiredPanes())\n.apply(CalculateWindowLength());\nPCollection averageSessionLengths = PCollectionList\n.of(mobileSessions).and(consoleSessions)\n.apply(Flatten.pCollections())\n.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(2)))\n.triggering(AtWatermark())\n.apply(Mean.globally());\nIf we were to see this pipeline in action, it would look something like\nFigure 3-5. As before, the two input pipelines are computing individual\nsession lengths for mobile and console players. Those session lengths then\nfeed into the second stage of the pipeline, where global session-length\naverages are computed in fixed windows.\nFigure 3-5. Average session lengths of mobile and console gaming sessions\nLet’s walk through some of this example, given that there’s a lot going on.\nThe two important points here are:\nThe output watermark for each of the Mobile Sessions and Console\nSessions stages is at least as old as the corresponding input\nwatermark of each, and in reality a little bit older. This is because in\na real system computing answers takes time, and we don’t allow the\noutput watermark to advance until processing for a given input has\ncompleted.\nThe input watermark for the Average Session Lengths stage is the\nminimum of the output watermarks for the two stages directly\nupstream.\nThe result is that the downstream input watermark is an alias for the\nminimum composition of the upstream output watermarks. Note that this\nmatches the definitions for those two types of watermarks earlier in the\nchapter. Also notice how watermarks further downstream are further in the\npast, capturing the intuitive notion that upstream stages are going to be\nfurther ahead in time than the stages that follow them.\nOne observation worth making here is just how cleanly we were able to ask\nthe questions again in Example 3-1 to substantially alter the results of the\npipeline. Whereas before we simply computed per-user session lengths, we\nnow compute two-minute global session-length averages. This provides a\nmuch more insightful look into the overall behaviors of the users playing our\ngames and gives you a tiny glimpse of the difference between simple data\ntransformations and real data science.\n00:00 / 00:00\nEven better, now that we understand the basics of how this pipeline operates,\nwe can look more closely at one of the more subtle issues related to asking\nthe four questions over again: output timestamps.\nWatermark Propagation and Output Timestamps\nIn Figure 3-5, I glossed over some of the details of output timestamps. But if\nyou look closely at the second stage in the diagram, you can see that each of\nthe outputs from the first stage was assigned a timestamp that matched the\nend of its window. Although that’s a fairly natural choice for output\ntimestamps, it’s not the only valid choice. As you know from earlier in this\nchapter, watermarks are never allowed to move backward. Given that\nrestriction, you can infer that the range of valid timestamps for a given\nwindow begins with the timestamp of the earliest nonlate record in the\nwindow (because only nonlate records are guaranteed to hold a watermark\nup) and extends all the way to positive infinity. That’s quite a lot of options.\nIn practice, however, there tend to be only a few choices that make sense in\nmost circumstances:\nEnd of the window\nUsing the end of the window is the only safe choice if you want the\noutput timestamp to be representative of the window bounds. As we’ll see\nin a moment, it also allows the smoothest watermark progression out of\nall of the options.\nTimestamp of first nonlate element\nUsing the timestamp of the first nonlate element is a good choice when\nyou want to keep your watermarks as conservative as possible. The trade-\noff, however, is that watermark progress will likely be more hindered, as\nwe’ll also see shortly.\nTimestamp of a specific element\nFor certain use cases, the timestamp of some other arbitrary (from the\nsystem’s perspective) element is the right choice. Imagine a use case in\nwhich you’re joining a stream of queries to a stream of clicks on results\n4\nfor that query. After performing the join, some systems will find the\ntimestamp of the query to be more useful; others will prefer the\ntimestamp of the click. Any such timestamp is valid from a watermark\ncorrectness perspective, as long as it corresponded to an element that did\nnot arrive late.\nHaving thought a bit about some alternate options for output timestamps,\nlet’s look at what effects the choice of output timestamp can have on the\noverall pipeline. To make the changes as dramatic as possible, in Example 3-\n3 and Figure 3-6, we’ll switch to using the earliest timestamp possible for the\nwindow: the timestamp of the first nonlate element as the timestamp for the\nwindow.\nExample 3-3. Average session lengths pipeline, that output timestamps for\nsession windows set at earliest element\nPCollection mobileSessions = IO.read(new MobileInputSource())\n.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n.triggering(AtWatermark())\n.withTimestampCombiner(EARLIEST)\n.discardingFiredPanes())\n.apply(CalculateWindowLength());\nPCollection consoleSessions = IO.read(new ConsoleInputSource())\n.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n.triggering(AtWatermark())\n.withTimestampCombiner(EARLIEST)\n.discardingFiredPanes())\n.apply(CalculateWindowLength());\nPCollection averageSessionLengths = PCollectionList\n.of(mobileSessions).and(consoleSessions)\n.apply(Flatten.pCollections())\n.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(2)))\n.triggering(AtWatermark())\n.apply(Mean.globally());\nFigure 3-6. Average session lengths for sessions that are output at the timestamp of the\nearliest element\nTo help call out the effect of the output timestamp choice, look at the dashed\nlines in the first stages showing what the output watermark for each stage is\nbeing held to. The output watermark is delayed by our choice of timestamp,\nas compared to Figures 3-7 and 3-8, in which the output timestamp was\nchosen to be the end of the window. You can see from this diagram that the\ninput watermark of the second stage is thus subsequently also delayed.\nFigure 3-7. Comparison of watermarks and results with different choice of window outout\n00:00 / 00:00\ntimestamps. The watermarks in this figure correspond to output timestamps at the end of\nthe session windows (i.e., Figure 3-5).\nFigure 3-8. In this figure, the watermarks are at the beginning of the session windows (i.e.,\nFigure 3-6). We can see that the watermark line in this figure is more delayed, and the\nresulting average session lengths are different.\nAs far as differences in this version compared to Figure 3-7, two are worth\nnoting:\nWatermark delay\nCompared to Figure 3-5, the watermark proceeds much more slowly in\nFigure 3-6. This is because the output watermark for the first stage is held\nback to the timestamp of the first element in every window until the input\nfor that window becomes complete. Only after a given window has been\nmaterialized is the output watermark (and thus the downstream input\nwatermark) allowed to advance.\nSemantic differences\nBecause the session timestamps are now assigned to match the earliest\nnonlate element in the session, the individual sessions often end up in\ndifferent fixed window buckets when we then calculate the session-length\naverages in the next stage. There’s nothing inherently right or wrong\nabout either of the two options we’ve seen so far; they’re just different.\nBut it’s important to understand that they will be different as well as have\nan intuition for the way in which they’ll be different so that you can make\nthe correct choice for your specific use case when the time comes.\nThe Tricky Case of Overlapping Windows\nOne additional subtle but important issue regarding output timestamps is how\nto handle sliding windows. The naive approach of setting the output\ntimestamp to the earliest element can very easily lead to delays downstream\ndue to watermarks being (correctly) held back. To see why, consider an\nexample pipeline with two stages, each using the same type of sliding\nwindows. Suppose that each element ends up in three successive windows.\nAs the input watermark advances, the desired semantics for sliding windows\nin this case would be as follows:\nThe first window completes in the first stage and is emitted\ndownstream.\nThe first window then completes in the second stage and can also be\nemitted downstream.\nSome time later, the second window completes in the first stage...\nand so on.\nHowever, if output timestamps are chosen to be the timestamp of the first\nnonlate element in the pane, what actually happens is the following:\nThe first window completes in the first stage and is emitted\ndownstream.\nThe first window in the second stage remains unable to complete\nbecause its input watermark is being held up by the output\nwatermark of the second and third windows upstream. Those\nwatermarks are rightly being held back because the earliest element\ntimestamp is being used as the output timestamp for those windows.\nThe second window completes in the first stage and is emitted\ndownstream.\nThe first and second windows in the second stage remain unable to\ncomplete, held up by the third window upstream.\nThe third window completes in the first stage and is emitted\ndownstream.\nThe first, second, and third windows in the second stage are now all\nable to complete, finally emitting all three in one swoop.\nAlthough the results of this windowing are correct, this leads to the results\nbeing materialized in an unnecessarily delayed way. Because of this, Beam\nhas special logic for overlapping windows that ensures the output timestamp\nfor window N +1 is always greater than the end of window N.\nPercentile Watermarks\nSo far, we have concerned ourselves with watermarks as measured by the\nminimum event time of active messages in a stage. Tracking the minimum\nallows the system to know when all earlier timestamps have been accounted\nfor. On the other hand, we could consider the entire distribution of event\ntimestamps for active messages and make use of it to create finer-grained\ntriggering conditions.\nInstead of considering the minimum point of the distribution, we could take\nany percentile of the distribution and say that we are guaranteed to have\nprocessed this percentage of all events with earlier timestamps.\nWhat is the advantage of this scheme? If for the business logic “mostly”\ncorrect is sufficient, percentile watermarks provide a mechanism by which\n5\nthe watermark can advance more quickly and more smoothly than if we were\ntracking the minimum event time by discarding outliers in the long tail of the\ndistribution from the watermark. Figure 3-9 shows a compact distribution of\nevent times where the 90 percentile watermark is close to the 100\npercentile. Figure 3-10 demonstrates a case where the outlier is further\nbehind, so the 90 percentile watermark is significantly ahead of the 100\npercentile. By discarding the outlier data from the watermark, the percentile\nwatermark can still keep track of the bulk of the distribution without being\ndelayed by the outliers.\nFigure 3-9. Normal-looking watermark histogram\nFigure 3-10. Watermark histogram with outliers\nth th\nth th\nFigure 3-11 shows an example of percentile watermarks used to draw\nwindow boundaries for two-minute fixed windows. We can draw early\nboundaries based on the percentile of timestamps of arrived data as tracked\nby the percentile watermark.\nFigure 3-11. Effects of varying watermark percentiles. As the percentile increases, more\nevents are included in the window: however, the processing time delay to materialize the\nwindow also increases.\nFigure 3-11 shows the 33 percentile, 66 percentile, and 100 percentile\n(full) watermark, tracking the respective timestamp percentiles in the data\ndistribution. As expected, these allow boundaries to be drawn earlier than\ntracking the full 100 percentile watermark. Notice that the 33 and 66\npercentile watermarks each allow earlier triggering of windows but with the\ntrade-off of marking more data as late. For example, for the first window,\n[12:00, 12:02), a window closed based on the 33 percentile watermark\nwould include only four events and materialize the result at 12:06 processing\ntime. If we use the 66 percentile watermark, the same event-time window\nwould include seven events, and materialize at 12:07 processing time. Using\nthe 100 percentile watermark includes all ten events and delays\nmaterializing the results until 12:08 processing time. Thus, percentile\nwatermarks provide a way to tune the trade-off between latency of\nmaterializing results and precision of the results.\nProcessing-Time Watermarks\nUntil now, we have been looking at watermarks as they relate to the data\nflowing through our system. We have seen how looking at the watermark can\nhelp us identify the overall delay between our oldest data and real time.\n00:00 / 00:00\nrd th th\nth rd th\nrd\nth\nth\nHowever, this is not enough to distinguish between old data and a delayed\nsystem. In other words, by only examining the event-time watermark as we\nhave defined it up until now, we cannot distinguish between a system that is\nprocessing data from an hour ago quickly and without delay, and a system\nthat is attempting to process real-time data and has been delayed for an hour\nwhile doing so.\nTo make this distinction, we need something more: processing-time\nwatermarks. We have already seen that there are two time domains in a\nstreaming system: processing time and event time. Until now, we have\ndefined the watermark entirely in the event-time domain, as a function of\ntimestamps of the data flowing through the system. This is an event-time\nwatermark. We will now apply the same model to the processing-time\ndomain to define a processing-time watermark.\nOur stream processing system is constantly performing operations such as\nshuffling messages between stages, reading or writing messages to persistent\nstate, or triggering delayed aggregations based on watermark progress. All of\nthese operations are performed in response to previous operations done at the\ncurrent or upstream stage of the pipeline. Thus, just as data elements “flow”\nthrough the system, a cascade of operations involved in processing these\nelements also “flows” through the system.\nWe define the processing-time watermark in the exact same way as we have\ndefined the event-time watermark, except instead of using the event-time\ntimestamp of oldest work not yet completed, we use the processing-time\ntimestamp of the oldest operation not yet completed. An example of delay to\nthe processing-time watermark could be a stuck message delivery from one\nstage to another, a stuck I/O call to read state or external data, or an exception\nwhile processing that prevents processing from completing.\nThe processing-time watermark, therefore, provides a notion of processing\ndelay separate from the data delay. To understand the value of this\ndistinction, consider the graph in Figure 3-12 where we look at the event-time\nwatermark delay.\nWe see that the data delay is monotonically increasing, but there is not\nenough information to distinguish between the cases of a stuck system and\nstuck data. Only by looking at the processing-time watermark, shown in\nFigure 3-13, can we distinguish the cases.\nFigure 3-12. Event-time watermark increasing. It is not possible to know from this\ninformation whether this is due to data buffering or system processing delay.\nFigure 3-13. Processing-time watermark also increasing. This indicates that the system\nprocessing is delayed.\nIn the first case (Figure 3-12), when we examine the processing-time\nwatermark delay we see that it too is increasing. This tells us that an\noperation in our system is stuck, and the stuckness is also causing the data\ndelay to fall behind. Some real-world examples of situations in which this\nmight occur are when there is a network issue preventing message delivery\nbetween stages of a pipeline or if a failure has occurred and is being retried.\nIn general, a growing processing-time watermark indicates a problem that is\npreventing operations from completing that are necessary to the system’s\nfunction, and often involves user or administrator intervention to resolve.\nIn this second case, as seen in Figure 3-14, the processing-time watermark\ndelay is small. This tells us that there are no stuck operations. The event-time\nwatermark delay is still increasing, which indicates that we have some\nbuffered state that we are waiting to drain. This is possible, for example, if\nwe are buffering some state while waiting for a window boundary to emit an\naggregation, and corresponds to a normal operation of the pipeline, as in\nFigure 3-15.\nFigure 3-14. Event-time watermark delay increasing, processing-time watermark stable.\nThis is an indication that data are buffered in the system and waiting to be processed,\nrather than an indication that a system operation is preventing data processing from\ncompleting.\nFigure 3-15. Watermark delay for fixed windows. The event-time watermark delay\nincreases as elements are buffered for each window, and decreases as each window’s\naggregate is emitted via an on-time trigger, whereas the processing-time watermark simply\ntracks system-level delays (which remain relatively steady in a healthy pipeline).\nTherefore, the processing-time watermark is a useful tool in distinguishing\nsystem latency from data latency. In addition to visibility, we can use the\nprocessing-time watermark at the system-implementation level for tasks such\nas garbage collection of temporary state (Reuven talks more about an\nexample of this in Chapter 5).\nCase Studies\nNow that we’ve laid the groundwork for how watermarks ought to behave,\nit’s time to take a look at some real systems to understand how different\nmechanisms of the watermark are implemented. We hope that these shed\nsome light on the trade-offs that are possible between latency and correctness\nas well as scalability and availability for watermarks in real-world systems.\nCase Study: Watermarks in Google Cloud\nDataflow\nThere are many possible approaches to implementing watermarks in a stream\nprocessing system. Here, we present a quick survey of the implementation in\nGoogle Cloud Dataflow, a fully managed service for executing Apache Beam\npipelines. Dataflow includes SDKs for defining data processing workflows,\nand a Cloud Platform managed service to run those workflows on Google\nCloud Platform resources.\nDataflow stripes (shards) each of the data processing steps in its data\nprocessing graph across multiple physical workers by splitting the available\nkeyspace of each worker into key ranges and assigning each range to a\nworker. Whenever a GroupByKey operation with distinct keys is encountered,\ndata must be shuffled to corresponding keys.\nFigure 3-16 depicts a logical representation of the processing graph with a\nGroupByKey.\nFigure 3-16. A GroupByKey step consumes data from another DoFn. This means that there\nis a data shuffle between the keys of the first step and the keys of the second step.\nWhereas the physical assignment of key ranges to workers might look\nFigure 3-17.\nFigure 3-17. Key ranges of both steps are assigned (striped) across the available workers.\nIn the watermark propagation section, we discussed that the watermark is\nmaintained for multiple subcomponents of each step. Dataflow keeps track of\nthe per-range watermarks of each of these components. Watermark\naggregation then involves computing the minimum of each watermark across\nall ranges, ensuring that the following guarantees are met:\nAll ranges must be reporting a watermark. If a watermark is not\npresent for a range, we cannot advance the watermark, because a\nrange not reporting must be treated as unknown.\nEnsure that the watermark is monotonically increasing. Because late\ndata is possible, we must not update the watermark if it would cause\nthe watermark to move backward.\nGoogle Cloud Dataflow performs aggregation via a centralized aggregator\nagent. We can shard this agent for efficiency. From a correctness standpoint,\nthe watermark aggregator serves as a “single source of truth” about the\nwatermark.\nEnsuring correctness in distributed watermark aggregation poses certain\nchallenges. It is paramount that watermarks are not advanced prematurely\nbecause advancing the watermark prematurely will turn on-time data into late\ndata. Specifically, as physical assignments are actuated to workers, the\nworkers maintain leases on the persistent state attached to the key ranges,\nensuring that only a single worker may mutate the persistent state for a key.\nTo guarantee watermark correctness, we must ensure that each watermark\nupdate from a worker process is admitted into the aggregate only if the\nworker process still maintains a lease on its persistent state; therefore, the\nwatermark update protocol must take state ownership lease validation into\naccount.\nCase Study: Watermarks in Apache Flink\nApache Flink is an open source stream processing framework for distributed,\nhigh-performing, always-available, and accurate data streaming applications.\nIt is possible to run Beam programs using a Flink runner. In doing so, Beam\nrelies on the implementation of stream processing concepts such as\nwatermarks within Flink. Unlike Google Cloud Dataflow, which implements\nwatermark aggregation via a centralized watermark aggregator agent, Flink\nperforms watermark tracking and aggregation in-band.\nTo understand how this works, let’s look at a Flink pipeline, as shown in\nFigure 3-18.\nFigure 3-18. A Flink pipeline with two sources and event-time watermarks propagating in-\nband\nIn this pipeline data is generated at two sources. These sources also both\ngenerate watermark “checkpoints” that are sent synchronously in-band with\nthe data stream. This means that when a watermark checkpoint from source A\nfor timestamp “53” is emitted, it guarantees that no nonlate data messages\nwill be emitted from source A with timestamp behind “53”. The downstream\n“keyBy” operators consume the input data and the watermark checkpoints.\nAs new watermark checkpoints are consumed, the downstream operators’\nview of the watermark is advanced, and a new watermark checkpoint for\ndownstream operators can be emitted.\nThis choice to send watermark checkpoints in-band with the data stream\ndiffers from the Cloud Dataflow approach that relies on central aggregation\nand leads to a few interesting trade-offs.\n6\nFollowing are some advantages of in-band watermarks:\nReduced watermark propagation latency, and very low-latency watermarks\nBecause it is not necessary to have watermark data traverse multiple hops\nand await central aggregation, it is possible to achieve very low latency\nmore easily with the in-band approach.\nNo single point of failure for watermark aggregation\nUnavailability in the central watermark aggregation agent will lead to a\ndelay in watermarks across the entire pipeline. With the in-band\napproach, unavailability of part of the pipeline cannot cause watermark\ndelay to the entire pipeline.\nInherent scalability\nAlthough Cloud Dataflow scales well in practice, more complexity is\nneeded to achieve scalability with a centralized watermark aggregation\nservice versus implicit scalability with in-band watermarks.\nHere are some advantages of out-of-band watermark aggregation:\nSingle source of “truth”\nFor debuggability, monitoring, and other applications such as throttling\ninputs based on pipeline progress, it is advantageous to have a service that\ncan vend the values of watermarks rather than having watermarks implicit\nin the streams, with each component of the system having its own partial\nview.\nSource watermark creation\nSome source watermarks require global information. For example,\nsources might be temprarily idle, have low data rates, or require out-of-\nband information about the source or other system components to\ngenerate the watermarks. This is easier to achieve in a central service. For\nan example see the case study that follows on source watermarks for\nGoogle Cloud Pub/Sub.\nCase Study: Source Watermarks for Google Cloud\nPub/Sub\nGoogle Cloud Pub/Sub is a fully managed real-time messaging service that\nallows you to send and receive messages between independent applications.\nHere, we discuss how to create a reasonable heuristic watermark for data sent\ninto a pipeline via Cloud Pub/Sub.\nFirst, we need to describe a little about how Pub/Sub works. Messages are\npublished on Pub/Sub topics. A particular topic can be subscribed to by any\nnumber of Pub/Sub subscriptions. The same messages are delivered on all\nsubscriptions subscribed to a given topic. The method of delivery is for\nclients to pull messages off the subscription, and to ack the receipt of\nparticular messages via provided IDs. Clients do not get to choose which\nmessages are pulled, although Pub/Sub does attempt to provide oldest\nmessages first, with no hard guarantees around this.\nTo build a heuristic, we make some assumptions about the source that is\nsending data into Pub/Sub. Specifically, we assume that the timestamps of the\noriginal data are “well behaved”; in other words, we expect a bounded\namount of out-of-order timestamps on the source data, before it is sent to\nPub/Sub. Any data that are sent with timestamps outside the allowed out-of-\norder bounds will be considered late data. In our current implementation, this\nbound is at least 10 seconds, meaning reordering of timestamps up to 10\nseconds before sending to Pub/Sub will not create late data. We call this\nvalue the estimation band. Another way to look at this is that when the\npipepline is perfectly caught up with the input, the watermark will be 10\nseconds behind real time to allow for possible reorderings from the source. If\nthe pipeline is backlogged, all of the backlog (not just the 10-second band) is\nused for estimating the watermark.\nWhat are the challenges we face with Pub/Sub? Because Pub/Sub does not\nguarantee ordering, we must have some kind of additional metadata to know\nenough about the backlog. Luckily, Pub/Sub provides a measurement of\nbacklog in terms of the “oldest unacknowledged publish timestamp.” This is\nnot the same as the event timestamp of our message, because Pub/Sub is\nagnostic to the application-level metadata being sent through it; instead, this\nis the timestamp of when the message was ingested by Pub/Sub.\nThis measurement is not the same as an event-time watermark. It is in fact the\nprocessing-time watermark for Pub/Sub message delivery. The Pub/Sub\npublish timestamps are not equal to the event timestamps, and in the case that\nhistorical (past) data are being sent, it might be arbitrarily far away. The\nordering on these timestamps might also be different because, as mentioned\nearlier, we allow a limited amount of reordering.\nHowever, we can use this as a measure of backlog to learn enough\ninformation about the event timestamps present in the backlog so that we can\ncreate a reasonable watermark as follows.\nWe create two subscriptions to the topic containing the input messages: a\nbase subscription that the pipeline will actually use to read the data to be\nprocessed, and a tracking subscription , which is used for metadata only, to\nperform the watermark estimation.\nTaking a look at our base subscription in Figure 3-19, we see that messages\nmight arrive out of order. We label each message with its Pub/Sub publish\ntimestamp “pt” and its event-time timestamp “et.” Note that the two time\ndomains can be unrelated.\nFigure 3-19. Processing-time and event-time timestamps of messages arriving on a\nPub/Sub subscription\nSome messages on the base subscription are unacknowledged forming a\nbacklog. This might be due to them not yet being delivered or they might\nhave been delivered but not yet processed. Remember also that pulls from\nthis subscription are distributed across multiple shards. Thus, it is not\npossible to say just by looking at the base subscription what our watermark\nshould be.\nThe tracking subscription, seen in Figure 3-20, is used to effectively inspect\nthe backlog of the base subscription and take the minimum of the event\ntimestamps in the backlog. By maintaining little or no backlog on the\ntracking subscription, we can inspect the messages ahead of the base\nsubsciption’s oldest unacknowledged message.\nFigure 3-20. An additional “tracking” subscription receiving the same messages as the\n“base” subscription\nWe stay caught up on the tracking subscription by ensuring that pulling from\nthis subscription is computationally inexpensive. Conversely, if we fall\nsufficiently behind on the tracking subscription, we will stop advancing the\nwatermark. To do so, we ensure that at least one of the following conditions\nis met:\nThe tracking subscription is sufficiently ahead of the base\nsubscription. Sufficiently ahead means that the tracking subscription\nis ahead by at least the estimation band. This ensures that any\nbounded reorder within the estimation band is taken into account.\nThe tracking subscription is sufficiently close to real time. In other\nwords, there is no backlog on the tracking subscription.\nWe acknowledge the messages on the tracking subscription as soon as\npossible, after we have durably saved metadata about the publish and event\ntimestamps of the messages. We store this metadata in a sparse histogram\nformat to minimize the amount of space used and the size of the durable\nwrites.\nFinally, we ensure that we have enough data to make a reasonable watermark\nestimate. We take a band of event timestamps we’ve read from our tracking\nsubscription with publish timestamps newer than the oldest unacknowledged\nof the base subscription, or the width of the estimation band. This ensures\nthat we consider all event timestamps in the backlog, or if the backlog is\nsmall, the most recent estimation band, to make a watermark estimate.\nFinally, the watermark value is computed to be the minimum event time in\nthe band.\nThis method is correct in the sense that all timestamps within the reordering\nlimit of 10 seconds at the input will be accounted for by the watermark and\nnot appear as late data. However, it produces possibly an overly conservative\nwatermark, one that advances “too slowly” in the sense described in\nChapter 2. Because we consider all messages ahead of the base subscription’s\noldest unacknowledged message on the tracking subscription, we can include\nevent timestamps in the watermark estimate for messages that have already\nbeen acknowledged.\nAdditionally, there are a few heuristics to ensure progress. This method\nworks well in the case of dense, frequently arriving data. In the case of sparse\nor infrequent data, there might not be enough recent messages to build a\nreasonable estimate. In the case that we have not seen data on the\nsubscription in more than two minutes (and there’s no backlog), we advance\nthe watermark to near real time. This ensures that the watermark and the\npipeline continue to make progress even if no more messages are\nforthcoming.\nAll of the above ensures that as long as source data-event timestamp\nreordering is within the estimation band, there will be no additional late data.\n"}}}
